<span>Protect yourself from dangerous EMF radiations: <a href="https://dq271.isrefer.com/go/AultHome/AUL651/" rel="external nofollow">Nature's solution to 5G, 4G, Small Cells and wireless radiation</a></span>
<p>
<br /><span>Published Scientific Research on 5G, Small Cells  Wireless and Health</span>
</p>
<p>
 
</p>
</div>
<p>
Published peer reviewed science already indicates that the current wireless technologies of 2G, 3G and 4G – in use today with our cell phones, computers and wearable tech – creates (create) radiofrequency exposures which poses (pose) a serious health risk to humans, animals and the environment. Scientists are cautioning that before rolling out 5G, research on human health effects urgently needs to be done first  to ensure the public and environment are protected.
</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p>
“Small cells” are microwave antennas (basicallyshorter cell towers) rapidly being installed in public areas on utility poles and street lights in front of homes, parks and schools. Just like cell towers, these wireless antennas generate and emit microwave radiofrequency (RF) radiation to transmit 2G, 3G and 4G network signals. Companies soon plan to add a new technology called 5G which will use current 4G technology plus even higher frequencies. The higher frequencies include millimeter-wave emissions that were not previously released into public areas.
</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p>
Companies state that these <a href="https://www.gsma.com/publicpolicy/arbitrary-radio-frequency-exposure-limits-impact-on-4g-network-deployment-2" rel="external nofollow">4G</a> and <a href="https://ehtrust.org/itu-report-emf-limits-on-5g/" rel="external nofollow">5G</a> antennas will <a href="https://ehtrust.org/itu-report-emf-limits-on-5g/" rel="external nofollow">increase</a> the wireless radiation levels in the area so much that they are working to loosen several governments’ radiation limits in order to roll it out. More than 240 scientists <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/298533689_International_Appeal_Scientists_call_for_protection_from_non-ionizing_electromagnetic_field_exposure" rel="external nofollow">published</a> an appeal to the United Nations to reduce public exposure and called for a <a href="https://www.emfcall.org/the-emf-call/" rel="external nofollow">moratorium on 5G</a> citing “established” adverse biological effects of RF radiation.
</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p>
5G will utilize not only the frequencies currently in use, but also higher millimeter wave and sub-millimeter wave frequencies. Small cells being installed in cities are usually 4G technology with a wide variety of frequencies. Thus, when we consider the health impacts of 5G and small cells we are looking at research on current technologies and frequencies in use in addition to research on sub-millimeter and millimeter waves. The 5G standard is new  there are no studies that have looked at long term human exposure to 5G. However the current body of research finding effects from current wireless technology provides enough data for scientists to call for a moratorium.

<span>“</span><a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2018.01.016" rel="external nofollow">5G Wireless Expansion: Public Health and Environmental Implications</a><span>” is a research review that documents the range of reported adverse effects of RF and millimeter waves—effects range from cancer to bacteria growth changes to DNA damage. The study concludes that “a moratorium on the deployment of 5G is warranted” and “the addition of this added high frequency 5G radiation to an already complex mix of lower frequencies, will contribute to a negative public health outcome … from both physical and mental health perspectives” (</span><a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2018.01.016" rel="external nofollow">Russell 2018</a><span>).</span>

<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S037842742030028X" rel="external nofollow">“Adverse Health Effects of 5G Mobile Networking Technology Under Real  Life Conditions” </a><span>identifies the wide-spectrum of adverse health effects of non-ionizing non-visible radiation and concludes that 5 G mobile networking technology will affect not only the skin and eyes, but will have adverse systemic effects as well. They state that 5G will increase the cell tower densities by an order of magnitude. Radiation could penetrate much deeper into a small animal in comparison to a human,  because of the much smaller animal size. The researchers point out that most laboratory experiments were not designed to identify the more severe adverse effects reflective of real-life conditions. </span>
</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p>
<span>For example, they do not include the real-life pulsing and modulation of the carrier signal and do not reflect the real life exposures of various modulations. In addition, the vast majority of experiments do not account for synergistic adverse effects of other toxic stimuli with wireless radiation despite the reality that people are exposed to a myriad of toxic insults every day. Science has documented additive, synergistic, potentiative, and/or antagonistic effects created by the combination of exposures. Combined exposure to a toxic stimuli and wireless translates into much lower levels of tolerance for each toxic stimulus and the exposure limits for wireless radiation when examined in combination with other potentially toxic stimuli would be far lower for safety purposes than those derived from wireless radiation exposures in isolation.</span>
</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p>
<span>The authors contend that almost all of the wireless radiation laboratory experiments that have been performed to date are flawed/limited with respect to showing the full adverse impact of the wireless radiation that would be expected under real-life conditions because they did not include signal information and only used single stressors. The researchers conclude that in aggregate, for the high frequency (radiofrequency-RF) part of the spectrum, currently published reviews show that RF radiation below the FCC guidelines can result in: carcinogenicity (brain tumors/glioma, breast cancer, acoustic neuromas, leukemia, parotid gland tumors), genotoxicity (DNA damage, DNA repair inhibition, chromatin structure), mutagenicity, teratogenicity,  neurodegenerative diseases (Alzheimer’s Disease, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis), neurobehavioral problems, autism, reproductive problems, pregnancy outcomes, excessive reactive oxygen species/oxidative stress, inflammation, apoptosis, blood-brain barrier disruption, pineal gland/melatonin production, sleep disturbance, headache, irritability, fatigue, concentration difficulties, depression, dizziness, tinnitus, burning and flushed skin, digestive disturbance, tremor, cardiac irregularities, adverse impacts on the neural, circulatory, immune, endocrine, and skeletal systems” and “from this perspective, RF is a highly pervasive cause of disease” (</span><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S037842742030028X" rel="external nofollow">Kostoff et al., 2020</a><span>)</span>

The scientists simulated exposures to RE-EMF at various frequencies from frequencies in use now with 3G  and 4G to higher frequencies  that will be used in 5G. They  combined this information with with in-situ measurements of environmental RF-EMF exposure near beehives in Belgium in order to estimate o estimate a realistic exposure of honey bees at different developmental stages. The analysis shows that a relatively small shift of 10% of environmental incident power density from frequencies below 3 GHz to higher frequencies will lead to a relative increase in absorbed power of a factor higher than 3. “Assuming that 10% of the incident power density would shift to frequencies higher than 3 GHz would lead to an increase of this absorption between 390–570%. Such a shift in frequencies is expected in future networks.”(<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-56948-0" rel="external nofollow">Thielens et al,. 2020</a>)

“In this paper, attenuation by human body and trees and penetration loss of different materials at 26 and 39 GHz are investigated for 5G wireless communications..”

“The results show that the upper bound of the KE model is better to predict the attenuation by a human body compared with UTD one-cylinder and two-cylinder models at both 26 and 39 GHz. ITU model overestimates the attenuation by willow trees, and a modified attenuation model by trees is proposed based on our measurements at 26 GHz.”

“It is found that the penetration loss for wood is smaller than that of transparent glass in the same thickness, and the penetration loss of frosted glass is slightly larger than that of transparent glass.”

“The measurement and modeling results in this paper are significant and necessary for simulation and planning of fifth-generation (5G) mm-wave radio systems in ITU recommended frequency bands at 26 and 39 GHz.”

“Second, the biophysical mechanism of biochemical release through cell membranes within the tissue regions that reach supraphysiologic temperatures is also considered. The released molecules are delivered to other skin regions by diffusion and into the bloodstream by perfusion, where according to our hypothesis, the molecules interact with susceptible cells. This raises the possibility of additional indirect injury at nearby deeper skin regions that experience insignificant heating. Biochemical release may also lead to injury at distant sites within the body by perfusion clearance that transfers molecules into the systemic circulation to reach other susceptible cells.”

<span>A published study entitled, “</span><a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8665432" rel="external nofollow">Effect of Mobile Tower Radiation on Microbial Diversity in Soil and Antibiotic Resistance”</a><span> took soil samples  from four different base stations located in Dausa city, and control samples from soil far from stations and then isolated and evaluated the microorganisms in the soil. The researchers found greater antibiotic resistance in microbes present in soil near base stations compared to the control and a  statistical significant difference in pattern of antibiotic resistance was found with Nalidixic acid, and cefixime when used as antimicrobial agents. The study concludes, “our findings suggest that mobile tower radiations can significantly alter the vital systems in microbes and turn them multidrug resistant (MDR) which is most important current threat to public health.”</span>

“On the horizon, a new generation of even shorter high frequency 5G wavelengths is being proposed to power the Internet of Things (IoT).”
</li>
<li>
“It is argued that the addition of this added high frequency 5G radiation to an already complex mix of lower frequencies, will contribute to a negative public health outcome both from both physical and mental health perspectives.”
</li>
<li>
“Like other common toxic exposures, the effects of radiofrequency electromagnetic radiation (RF EMR) will be problematic if not impossible to sort out epidemiologically as there no longer remains an unexposed control group. This is especially important considering these effects are likely magnified by synergistic toxic exposures and other common health risk behaviors. Effects can also be non-linear. Because this is the first generation to have cradle-to-grave lifespan exposure to this level of man-made microwave (RF EMR) radiofrequencies, it will be years or decades before the true health consequences are known. Precaution in the roll out of this new technology is strongly indicated.”
</li>
<li>
“Current radiofrequency radiation wavelengths we are exposed to appear to act as a toxin to biological systems. A moratorium on the deployment of 5G is warranted, along with development of independent health and environmental advisory boards that include independent scientists who research biological effects and exposure levels of radiofrequency radiation. Sound regulatory policy regarding current and future telecommunications initiative will require more careful assessment of risks to human health, environmental health, public safety, privacy, security and social consequences. Public health regulations need to be updated to match appropriate independent science with the adoption of biologically based exposure standards prior to further deployment of 4G or 5G technology.”

Experimentally we showed that the reflectance of the human skin in the sub-THz region depends on the intensity of perspiration, i.e. sweat duct’s conductivity, and correlates with levels of human stress (physical, mental and emotional). Later on, we detected circular dichroism in the reflectance from the skin, a signature of the axial mode of a helical antenna. The full ramifications of what these findings represent in the human condition are still unclear. We also revealed correlation of electrocardiography (ECG) parameters to the sub-THz reflection coefficient of human skin. In a recent work, we developed a unique simulation tool of human skin, taking into account the skin multi-layer structure together with the helical segment of the sweat duct embedded in it. The presence of the sweat duct led to a high specific absorption rate (SAR) of the skin in extremely high frequency band.
</li>
<li>
In this paper, we summarize the physical evidence for this phenomenon and consider its implication for the future exploitation of the electromagnetic spectrum by wireless communication. Starting from July 2016 the US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has adopted new rules for wireless broadband operations above 24 GHz (5 G). This trend of exploitation is predicted to expand to higher frequencies in the sub-THz region. One must consider the implications of human immersion in the electromagnetic noise, caused by devices working at the very same frequencies as those, to which the sweat duct (as a helical antenna) is most attuned.
</li>
<li>
We are raising a warning flag against the unrestricted use of sub-THz technologies for communication, before the possible consequences for public health are explored.

<span>Excerpts from abstract: “Insects are continually exposed to Radio-Frequency (RF) electromagnetic fields at different frequencies. This paper is the first to report the absorbed RF electromagnetic power in four different types of insects as a function of frequency from 2 GHz to 120 GHz. A set of insect models was obtained using novel Micro-CT (computer tomography) imaging. These models were used for the first time in finite-difference time-domain electromagnetic simulations. All insects showed a dependence of the absorbed power on the frequency. All insects showed a general increase in absorbed RF power at and above 6 GHz, in comparison to the absorbed RF power below 6 GHz. Our simulations showed that a shift of 10% of the incident power density to frequencies above 6 GHz would lead to an increase in absorbed power between 3–370%.”</span>
</li>
<li>
<span>“This could lead to changes in insect behaviour, physiology, and morphology over time due to an increase in body temperatures, from dielectric heating. The studied insects that are smaller than 1 cm show a peak in absorption at frequencies (above 6GHz), which are currently not often used for telecommunication, but are planned to be used in the next generation of wireless telecommunication systems.”</span>

<span>In 2008, we demonstrated that the coiled portion of the sweat duct in upper skin layer could be regarded as a helical antenna in the sub-THz band. The full ramifications of what these findings represent in the human condition are still very unclear,<span> but it is obvious that the absorption of electromagnetic energy is governed by the topology for the skin and its organelles, especially the sweat duct.</span></span>

“Prior research on human exposure to radio frequency (RF) fields in a cellular communications system has been focused on uplink only due to the closer physical contact of a transmitter to a human body. However, this paper claims the necessity of thorough investigation on human exposure to downlink RF fields, as cellular systems deployed in mmW bands will entail (i) deployment of more transmitters due to smaller cell size and (ii) higher concentration of RF energy using a highly directional antenna.
</li>
<li>
In this paper, we present human RF exposure levels in downlink of a Fifth Generation Wireless Systems (5G). Our results show that 5G downlink RF fields generate significantly higher power density (PD) and specific absorption rate (SAR) than a current cellular system. This paper also shows that SAR should also be taken into account for determining human RF exposure in the mmW downlink.”

Millimeter Waves (MMW) will be used in the next-generation of high-speed wireless technologies, especially in future Ultra-Broadband small cells in 5G cellular networks. Therefore, their biocompatibilities must be evaluated prior to their massive deployment. Using a microarray-based approach, we analyzed modifications to the whole genome of a human keratinocyte model that was exposed at 60.4 GHz-MMW at an incident power density (IPD) of 20 mW/cm<span>2</span> for 3 hours in athermic conditions. No keratinocyte transcriptome modifications were observed. We tested the effects of MMWs on cell metabolism by co-treating MMW-exposed cells with a glycolysis inhibitor, 2-deoxyglucose (2dG, 20 mM for 3 hours), and whole genome expression was evaluated along with the ATP content. We found that the 2dG treatment decreased the cellular ATP content and induced a high modification in the transcriptome (632 coding genes). The affected genes were associated with transcriptional repression, cellular communication and endoplasmic reticulum homeostasis. The MMW/2dG co-treatment did not alter the keratinocyte ATP content, but it did slightly alter the transcriptome, which reflected the capacity of MMW to interfere with the bioenergetic stress response. The RT-PCR-based validation confirmed 6 MMW-sensitive genes (<em>SOCS3</em>, <em>SPRY2</em>, <em>TRIB1</em>, <em>FAM46A</em>, <em>CSRNP1</em> and <em>PPP1R15A</em>) during the 2dG treatment. These 6 genes encoded transcription factors or inhibitors of cytokine pathways, which raised questions regarding the potential impact of long-term or chronic MMW exposure on metabolically stressed cells.

Abstract: Over the next years the demand of wireless communication will increase tremendously. More and more mobile end devices require a high data rate connection e.g. to a smart home (Internet of Things, IoT) or to the internet. The radiation power pattern of base stations and mobile end devices will completely change for the 5G Next Generation Mobile Network technology which will use frequency bands up to 100 GHz. Therefore the electromagnetic exposure especially to human body will increase in the future, because most of the wireless connections are realized in RF technology. In this contribution two different measurement setups are presented. The first shows the electromagnetic radiation regarding a base station powered by a mobile phone provider over a timespan of a number of days. The second figures out the electromagnetic radiation of a handheld mobile end device to a human head in an area with very poor reception values. The results of those measurements where compared with legal and health limits. All measured and calculated results regarding the base stations were within the legal exposure limits. The calculated legal exposure limits of mobile devices were exceeded twice in areas within very poor reception values. Regarding the expected higher bandwidth and corresponding higher electromagnetic exposure to human bodies in future there have to be periodic measurements to comply with radiation limits.
</li>
<li>
<p>
Excerpts: “Regarding the above mentioned circumstances it will be necessary to measure the radiation exposure of base stations in the future on a regular basis in order to ensure the legal limits and to reduce possible health hazards. It also will be necessary to develop new measurement strategies and/or technologies regarding the large frequency spectrum 5G will use up to 100 GHz. …When measuring directly on a mobile phone (simulating the use of an end device directly on the human head), it was found that the calculated SAR of 3.834 <i>W/kg</i> exceeds the legal limit of 2 W<i>/ kg</i>. This shows clearly that the legal limit values can be exceeded significantly in areas with very poor reception values …Increasing the distance between a mobile end device and the head, e.g. by using a hands-free set or a headset can significantly reduce the human exposure to electromagnetic radiation when such a device is used in badly supplied areas and transmits with maximum power.”

Extreme broadband wireless devices operating above 10 GHz may transmit data in bursts of a few milliseconds to seconds. Even though the time- and area-averaged power density values remain within the acceptable safety limits for continuous exposure, <span>these bursts may lead to short temperature spikes in the skin of exposed people.</span>

<span>This result indicates that careful consideration should be given while designing electronic and photonic devices operating in the sub-terahertz frequency region in order to avoid various effects on human health due to these waves.</span>

“Morphological, functional and biochemical studies conducted in humans and animals revealed that millimeterwave caused changes in the body manifested in structural alterations in the skin and internal organs, qualitative and quantitative changes of the blood and bone marrow composition and changes of the conditioned reflex activity, tissue respiration, activity of enzymes participating in the process of tissue respiration and nucleic metabolism. The degree of unfavorable effect of millimeterwave depended on the duration of the radiation and individual characteristics of the organism.”

<span>The studies reviewed demonstrate effects of low-intensity MMW (10 mW/cm2 and less) on cell growth and proliferation, activity of enzymes, state of cell genetic apparatus, function of excitable membranes, peripheral receptors, and other biological systems. In animals and humans, local MMW exposure stimulated tissue repair and regeneration, alleviated stress reactions, and facilitated recovery in a wide range of diseases (MMW therapy). Many reported MMW effects could not be readily explained by temperature changes during irradiation.”</span>

<span>“It is important to note that, even with the variety of bioeffects reported, no studies have provided evidence that a low-intensity MMW radiation represents a health hazard for human beings. Actually, none of the reviewed studies with low-intensity MMW even pursued the evaluation of health risks, though in view of numerous bioeffects and growing usage of MMW technologies this research objective appears very reasonable. Such MMW effects as alterations of cell growth rate and UV light sensitivity, biochemical and antibiotic resistivity changes in pathogenic bacteria, as well as many others are of potential significance for safety standards. MMW therapy in many cases employs field intensities comparable to or lower than allowed by current safety standards; still, even local and short-term exposures were reported to produce marked effects. It should also be realized that biological effects of a prolonged or chronic MMW exposure of the whole body or a large body area have never been investigated. Safety limits for these types of exposure are based solely on predictions of energy deposition and MMW heating, but in view of recent studies this approach is not necessarily adequate.”</span>
</li>
</ul><ul><li>
<span>This paper gives examples of today’s regulatory requirements, and provides an example for a 60 GHz transceiver. Also, the propagation characteristics of millimeter-waves in the presence of the human body are studied, and four models representing different body parts are considered to evaluate thermal effects of millimeter-wave radiation on the body. Simulation results show that about 34% to 42% of the incident power is reflected at the skin surface at 60 GHz. This paper shows that power density is not suitable to determine exposure compliance when millimeter wave devices are used very close to the body. A temperature-based technique for the evaluation of safety compliance is proposed in this paper.</span>

“A  literature survey representing the most recent available results related to the biological effects of mmWave exposure, from the well-understood and well-accepted effects of thermal heating to recent reports of nonthermal effects and the attempt to motivate further discussion and research for appropriate emission standards.”

<span>“We highlighted the findings of mmWave radiation studies on the eyes and skin since, in communication applications, these tissues would receive the most radiation, with other tissues receiving, by comparison, a negligible amount. Ocular injury can be induced by short-term high-intensity exposure (e.g., 2,000 mW/cm</span><span>2</span><span>, 1.5–5 s) far beyond the anticipated future communication device levels, but the eyes do not appear to suffer damage from longer low-intensity exposure (e.g., 10 mW/cm</span><span>2</span><span>, 8 h), which might be experienced from mmWave communication technologies in the far field.</span>
</li>
<li>
<span>More work may be required to determine the possible effects from exposure above 10 mW/cm</span><span>2</span><span> that might be experienced in the near field from specific communication devices with adaptive antennas as well as to ensure that mechanisms are in place to ensure that no hazardous levels of energy are transmitted into the eyes. We also showed that using typical power levels, there would be no unsafe temperature increase caused by exposure of skin to mmWave communication technologies in the far field.</span>
</li>
<li>
<span>As with the eyes, however, more work is required to determine temperature increases from higher exposure levels that might be experienced in the near field from specific communication devices with high-gain antennas and to develop and demonstrate reliable mechanisms to ensure that no hazardous levels of energy are transmitted to the skin.”</span>

<span>The millimeter waves (MMW) region of the electromagnetic spectrum, extending from 30 to 300 GHz in terms of frequency (corresponding to wavelengths from 10 mm to 1 mm), is officially used in non-invasive complementary medicine in many Eastern European countries against a variety of diseases such gastro duodenal ulcers, cardiovascular disorders, traumatism and tumor. On the other hand, besides technological applications in traffic and military systems, in the near future MMW will also find applications in high resolution and high-speed wireless communication technology. This has led to restoring interest in research on MMW induced biological effects. In this review emphasis has been given to the MMW-induced effects on cell membranes that are considered the major target for the interaction between MMW and biological systems.</span>

<span>“Electromagnetic Fields: A Hazard to Your Health?” on Cell Tower Radiation</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>“In recent years, concern has increased about exposure to radio frequency electromagnetic radiation emitted from cell phones and phone station antennae. An Egyptian study confirmed concerns that living nearby mobile phone base stations increased the risk for developing:</span>
</p>
<ul><li>
<span>Headaches</span>
</li>
<li>
<span>Memory problems</span>
</li>
<li>
<span>Dizziness</span>
</li>
<li>
<span>Depression</span>
</li>
<li>
<span>Sleep problems</span>
</li>
</ul><p>
<span>Short-term exposure to these fields in experimental studies have not always shown negative effects, but this does not rule out cumulative damage from these fields, so larger studies over longer periods are needed to help understand who is at risk. In large studies, an association has been observed between symptoms and exposure to these fields in the everyday environment.”</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>Compilation of Research Studies on Cell Tower Radiation and Health</span>
</p>
<ul><li>
<span>This study evaluated effects in the human blood of individuals living near mobile phone base stations (within 80 meters) compared with healthy controls (over 300 meters). The study found higher radiofrequency radiation exposures and statistically significant differences in the blood of people living closer to the cellular antennas. The  group living closer to the antennas had for example, statistically significant higher frequency of micronuclei and a rise in lipid peroxidation in their blood. These changes are considered biomarkers predictive of cancer.</span>
</li>
</ul><ul><li>
<span>This study found that living nearby mobile phone base stations (cell antennas) increased the risk for neuropsychiatric problems such as headaches, memory problems, dizziness, tremors,depression, sleep problems and some changes in the performance of neurobehavioral functions.  </span>
</li>
</ul><ul><li>
<span>This review of 100 studies found approximately 80% showed biological effects near towers. “Both anecdotal reports and some epidemiology studies have found headaches, skin rashes, sleep disturbances, depression, decreased libido, increased rates of suicide, concentration problems, dizziness, memory changes, increased risk of cancer, tremors, and other neurophysiological effects in populations near base stations.”  </span>
</li>
</ul><ul><li>
<span>This 10 year study on cell phone antennas by the Municipal Health Department in Belo Horizonte and several universities in Brazil found a clearly elevated relative risk of cancer mortality at residential distances of 500 meters or less from cell phone transmission towers. Shortly after this study was published, the city prosecutor sued several cell phone companies and requested that almost half of the cities antennas be removed. Many antennas were dismantled.</span>
</li>
</ul><ul><li>
<span>A review of 10 epidemiological studies that assessed for negative health effects of mobile phone base stations (4 studies were from Germany, and 1 each from Austria, Egypt, France, Israel, Poland, Spain) found that seven showed altered neurobehavioral effects near cell tower and three showed increased cancer incidence. The review also found that eight of the 10 studies reported increased prevalence of adverse neurobehavioral symptoms or cancer in populations living at distances &lt; 500 meters from base stations. Lower cognitive performance was found in  individuals living ≤ 10 meters from base stations. None of the studies reported exposure above accepted international guidelines, suggesting that current guidelines may be inadequate in protecting the health of human populations.</span>
</li>
</ul><ul><li>
<span>This  cross-sectional study found the symptoms of nausea, headache, dizziness, irritability, discomfort, nervousness, depression, sleep disturbance, memory loss and lowering of libido were statistically increased in people living closer than 300 m from cell antennas as compared to those living farther away. The study concludes that “antennas should not be sited closer than 300 m to people to minimize exposure.”</span>
</li>
</ul><ul><li>
<span>Even a year of operation of a powerful base transmitting station for mobile communication reportedly resulted in a dramatic increase of cancer incidence among population living nearby.  </span>
</li>
</ul><ul><li>
<span>Elementary school students who were exposed to high RF-EMFR generated by MPBS had a significantly higher risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus relative to their counterparts who were exposed to lower RF-EMFR.  </span>
</li>
</ul><ul><li>
<span>RFR exposures significantly impacted ACTH, cortisol, thyroid hormones, prolactin for  females, and testosterone levels for males.</span>
</li>
</ul><ul><li>
<span>People living near mobile phone masts reported more symptoms of headache, sleep disturbance, discomfort, irritability, depression, memory loss and concentration problems the closer they lived to the installation.  Study authors recommend that the minimal distance of people from cellular phone base stations should not be &lt; 300 m.</span>

<span>Two Important Animal Studies on Radiofrequency Radiation</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>These studies indicate that government limits are non protective. Government limits are based on the assumption that radiofrequency radiation is only harmful at thermal levels. However, the cancers developed in animals in these studies at radiation levels that were non thermal.</span>
</p>
<ul><li>
<span>Researchers with the renowned Ramazzini Institute (RI) in Italy performed a large-scale lifetime </span><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0013935118300367?via%3Dihub" rel="external nofollow">study</a><span> of lab animals exposed to environmental levels (comparable to allowable limits from cell towers) of RFR radiation and found the rats developed increased cancers- schwannoma of the heart in male rats. This study confirms the $25 million </span><a href="https://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/about/org/sep/trpanel/meetings/docs/2018/march/index.html" rel="external nofollow">US National Toxicology Program</a><span> study which used much higher levels of cell phone radiofrequency (RF) radiation, but also reported finding the same unusual cancers as the Ramazzini- schwannoma of the heart in male rats. In addition, the RI study of cell tower radiation also found increases in malignant brain (glial) tumors in female rats and precancerous conditions including Schwann cells hyperplasia in both male and female rats.</span>
</li>
<li>
<span>“Our findings of cancerous tumors in rats exposed to environmental levels of RF are consistent with and reinforce the results of the US NTP studies on cell phone radiation, as both reported increases in the same types of tumors of the brain and heart in Sprague-Dawley rats. Together, these studies provide sufficient evidence to call for the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) to re-evaluate and re-classify their conclusions regarding the carcinogenic potential of RFR in humans,” said Fiorella Belpoggi PhD, study author and RI Director of Research.</span>
</li>
<li>
<span>The Ramazzini study exposed 2448 Sprague-Dawley rats from prenatal life until their natural death to “environmental” cell tower radiation for 19 hours per day (1.8 GHz GSM radiofrequency radiation (RFR) of 5, 25 and 50 V/m). RI exposures mimicked base station emissions like those from cell tower antennas, and exposure levels were far less than those used in the NTP studies of cell phone radiation.</span>

</li>
</ul><ul><li>
<span>This 25 million dollar study is the most complex study completed by the NTP and the world’s largest rodent study on radiofrequency radiation exposure to date which found long term exposure at non thermal levels associated with brain cancer and schwannomas of the heart in male rats. In addition damage to heart was found in all exposure levels. The full report is expected to be released in Fall 2018.</span>
</li>
</ul><p>
<span>More Important Studies on Cell Tower Radiation  </span>
</p>
<ul><li>
<span>Radiofrequency radiation (RF) is increasingly being recognized as a new form of </span><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/environmental-pollution" rel="external nofollow">environmental pollution</a><span>.  This article  reviews relevant </span><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/electromagnetism" rel="external nofollow">electromagnetic</a><span> frequencies, exposure standards and current scientific literature on the health implications of 2G, 3G, 4G and 5G.</span>
</li>
<li>
<span>Effects can also be non-linear. Because this is the first generation to have cradle-to-grave lifespan exposure to this level of man-made microwave (RF EMR) radiofrequencies, it will be years or decades before the true health consequences are known. Precaution in the roll out of this new technology is strongly indicated.</span>
</li>
</ul><ul><li>
<span>Researchers have developed a unique simulation tool of human skin, taking into account the skin </span><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/laminates" rel="external nofollow">multi-layer structure</a><span> together with the helical segment of the sweat duct embedded in it. They found that the presence of the sweat duct led to a high specific absorption rate (SAR) of the skin in </span><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/extremely-high-frequencies" rel="external nofollow">extremely high frequency</a><span> band that will be used in 5G. “One must consider the implications of human immersion in the electromagnetic noise, caused by devices working at the very same frequencies as those, to which the sweat duct (as a helical antenna) is most attuned. We are raising a warning flag against the unrestricted use of sub-THz technologies for communication, before the possible consequences for public health are explored.”</span>
</li>
</ul><ul><li>
<span>This article was published in Environmental Science &amp; Policy by human rights experts. It argues that cell tower placement is a human rights issue for children.</span>
</li>
<li>
<span>“We argue that (1) because protection of children is a high threshold norm in Human Right  law and (2) the binding language of the Convention on the Rights of the Child obliges States Parties to provide a higher standard of protection for children than adults, any widespread or systematic form of environmental pollution that poses a long-term threat to a child’s rights to life, development or health may constitute an international human rights violation.</span>
</li>
<li>
<span>In particular we have explained how the dearth of legislation to regulate the installation of base stations  (cell towers) in close proximity to children’s facilities and schools clearly constitutes a human rights concern according to the language of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, a treaty that has been ratified by all European States.</span>
</li>
</ul><ul><li>
<span>This research looked at the radiation that cell towers emit and states a safety zone is needed around the towers to ensure safe sleeping areas. The authors state that “respective authorities should ensure that people reside far from the tower by 120m or more depending on the power transmitted to avoid severe health effect.”</span>
</li>
</ul><ul><li>
<span>This cross-sectional case control study on genetic damage in individuals living near cell towers found genetic damage parameters of DNA were significantly elevated. The authors state,” The genetic damage evident in the participants of this study needs to be addressed against future disease-risk, which in addition to neurodegenerative disorders, may lead to cancer.”</span>
</li>
</ul><ul><li>
<span>This review summarizes the evidence stating that excessive exposure to magnetic fields from power lines and other sources of electric current increases the risk of development of some cancers and neurodegenerative diseases, and that excessive exposure to RF radiation increases risk of cancer, male infertility, and neurobehavioral abnormalities.</span>
</li>
</ul><ul><li>
<span>Japanese study Showed Statistically Significant Adverse Health Effects from electromagnetic radiation from mobile phone base stations. Residents of a condominium building that had cell tower antennas on the rooftop were examined before and after cell tower antennas were removed. In 1998, 800MHz cell antennas were installed, then later in 2008 a second set of antennas (2GHz) were installed.  Medical exams and interviews were conducted before and after the antennas were removed in 2009 on 107 residents of the building who had no prior knowledge about possible. These results lead researchers to question the construction of mobile phone base stations on top of buildings such as condominiums or houses.</span>
</li>
</ul><ul><li>
<span>In our study, 116 persons exposed to radiation from mobile towers and 106 control subjects were genotyped for polymorphisms in the GSTM1 and GSTT1 genes by multiplex polymerase chain reaction method. DNA damage in peripheral blood lymphocytes was determined using alkaline comet assay in terms of tail moment (TM) value and micronucleus assay in buccal cells (BMN). Our results indicated that TM value and BMN frequency were higher in an exposed population compared with a control group and the difference is significant. In our study, we found that different health symptoms, such as depression, memory status, insomnia, and hair loss, were significantly associated with exposure to EMR. Damaging effects of nonionizing radiation result from the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and subsequent radical formation and from direct damage to cellular macromolecules including DNA.</span>
</li>
</ul><ul><li>
<span>Found a significant relationship between some cognitive symptoms and measured power density in 365 subjects; highest for headaches. Perceptual speed increased, while accuracy decreased insignificantly with increasing exposure levels.</span>
</li>
</ul><ul><li>
<span>A health survey was carried out in La Ñora, Murcia, Spain, in the vicinity of two GSM 900/1800 MHz cellular phone base stations. The adjusted (sex, age, distance) logistic regression model showed statistically significant positive exposure-response associations between the E-field and the following variables: fatigue, irritability, headaches, nausea, loss of appetite, sleeping disorder, depressive tendency, feeling of discomfort, difficulty in concentration, loss of memory, visual disorder, dizziness and cardiovascular problems.</span>
</li>
</ul><ul><li>
<span>Residents close to mobile phone masts reported: more incidences of circulatory problems, sleep disturbances, irritability, depression, blurred vision and concentration difficulties the nearer they lived to the mast.</span>
</li>
<li>
<span>The performed studies showed the relationship between the incidence of individual symptoms, the level of exposure, and the distance between a residential area and a base station.</span>
</li>
</ul><ul><li>
<span>A significant higher rate of cancer (300% increase) among all residents living within 300m radius of a mobile phone mast for between three and seven years was detected.</span>
</li>
<li>
<span>900% cancer increase among women alone</span>
</li>
<li>
<span>In the area of exposure (area A) eight cases of different kinds of cancer were diagnosed in a period of only one year. This rate of cancers was compared both with the rate of 31 cases per 10,000 per year in the general population and the 2/1222 rate recorded in the nearby clinic (area B). The study indicates an association between increased incidence of cancer and living in proximity to a cell-phone transmitter station.</span>
</li>
</ul><ul><li>
<span>German study showing elevated levels of stress hormones (adrenaline, noradrenaline), and lowered dopamine and PEA levels in urine in area residents during 1st 6 months of cell tower installation. Even after 1.5 years, the levels did not return to normal.</span>
</li>
</ul><ul><li>
<span>200% increase in the incidence of malignant tumors was found after five years’ exposure in people living within 400m radius of a mobile phone mast. The proportion of newly developing cancer cases is significantly higher among patients who live within 400 meters of a cell phone transmitter. Early age of cancer diagnosis.</span>
</li>
</ul><ul><li>
<span>“It can be seen from the above that 10 different well-documented microwave EMF effects can be easily explained as being a consequence of EMF VGCC activation: oxidative stress, elevated single and double strand breaks in DNA, therapeutic responses to such EMFs, breakdown of the blood-brain barrier, cancer, melatonin loss, sleep dysfunction, male infertility and female infertility.”</span>
</li>
</ul><ul><li>
<span>Non-thermal microwave/lower frequency electromagnetic fields (EMFs) act via voltage-gated calcium channel (VGCC) activation.</span>
</li>
<li>
<span>Two U.S. government reports from the 1970s to 1980s provide evidence for many neuropsychiatric effects of non-thermal microwave EMFs, based on occupational exposure studies. 18 more recent epidemiological studies, provide substantial evidence that microwave EMFs from cell/mobile phone base stations, excessive cell/mobile phone usage and from wireless smart meters can each produce similar patterns of neuropsychiatric effects, with several of these studies showing clear dose–response relationships.</span>
</li>
<li>
<span>Lesser evidence from 6 additional studies suggests that short wave, radio station, occupational and digital TV antenna exposures may produce similar neuropsychiatric effects. Among the more commonly reported changes are sleep disturbance/insomnia, headache, depression/depressive symptoms, fatigue/tiredness, dysesthesia, concentration/attention dysfunction, memory changes, dizziness, irritability, loss of appetite/body weight, restlessness/anxiety, nausea, skin burning/tingling/dermographism and EEG changes. In summary, then, the mechanism of action of microwave EMFs, the role of the VGCCs in the brain, the impact of non-thermal EMFs on the brain, extensive epidemiological studies performed over the past 50 years, and five criteria testing for causality, all collectively show that various non-thermal microwave EMF exposures produce diverse neuropsychiatric effects.</span>

Here's a contrary view.  I have to say, I agree with the YouTuber here, but I accept he may be wrong.  People who are knowledgeable/expert are often trapped in the box of received wisdom.

    "text": "Protect yourself from dangerous EMF radiations: Nature\u0027s solution to 5G, 4G, Small Cells and wireless radiation\n\t\n\t\tPublished Scientific Research on 5G, Small Cells\u00a0 Wireless and Health\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\u00a0\n\t\n\n\n\n\tPublished peer reviewed science already indicates that the current wireless technologies of 2G, 3G and 4G \u2013 in use today with our cell phones, computers and wearable tech \u2013 creates (create) radiofrequency exposures which poses (pose) a serious health risk to humans, animals and the environment. Scientists are cautioning that before rolling out 5G, research on human health effects urgently needs to be done first\u00a0 to ensure the public and environment are protected.\n\n\n\n\t\u00a0\n\n\n\n\t\u201cSmall cells\u201d are microwave antennas (basicallyshorter cell towers) rapidly being installed in public areas on utility poles and street lights in front of homes, parks and schools. Just like cell towers, these wireless antennas generate and emit microwave radiofrequency (RF) radiation to transmit 2G, 3G and 4G network signals. Companies soon plan to add a new technology called 5G which will use current 4G technology plus even higher frequencies. The higher frequencies include millimeter-wave emissions that were not previously released into public areas.\n\n\n\n\t\u00a0\n\n\n\n\tCompanies state that these\u00a04G\u00a0and\u00a05G\u00a0antennas will\u00a0increase\u00a0the wireless radiation levels in the area so much that they are working to loosen several governments\u2019 radiation limits in order to roll it out. More than 240 scientists\u00a0published\u00a0an appeal to the United Nations to reduce public exposure and called for a\u00a0moratorium on 5G\u00a0citing \u201cestablished\u201d adverse biological effects of RF radiation.\n\n\n\n\t\u00a0\n\n\n\n\t5G will utilize not only the frequencies currently in use, but also higher millimeter wave and sub-millimeter wave frequencies. Small cells being installed in cities are usually 4G technology with a wide variety of frequencies. Thus, when we consider the health impacts of 5G and small cells we are looking at research on current technologies and frequencies in use in addition to research on sub-millimeter and millimeter waves.\u00a0The 5G standard is new\u00a0 there are no studies that have looked at long term human exposure to 5G. However the current body of research finding effects from current wireless technology provides enough data for scientists to call for a moratorium.\n\n\n\n\t\u00a0\n\n\n\n\tThis page lists a small sampling of research on 5G, millimeter waves, cellular antennas, the environment and human health.\n\n\n\n\t\u201c5G Wireless Expansion: Public Health and Environmental Implications\u201d is a research review that documents the range of reported adverse effects of RF and millimeter waves\u2014effects range from cancer to bacteria growth changes to DNA damage. The study concludes that \u201ca moratorium on the deployment of 5G is warranted\u201d and \u201cthe addition of this added high frequency 5G radiation to an already complex mix of lower frequencies, will contribute to a negative public health outcome \u2026 from both physical and mental health perspectives\u201d (Russell 2018).\n\n\n\n\t\u00a0\n\n\n\n\t\u201cAdverse Health Effects of 5G Mobile Networking Technology Under Real\u00a0 Life Conditions\u201d\u00a0identifies the wide-spectrum of adverse health effects of non-ionizing non-visible radiation and concludes that 5\u2009G mobile networking technology will affect not only the skin and eyes, but will have adverse systemic effects as well. They state that 5G will increase the cell tower densities by an order of magnitude. Radiation could penetrate much deeper into a small animal in comparison to a human,\u00a0 because of the much smaller animal size. The researchers point out that most laboratory experiments were not designed to identify the more severe adverse effects reflective of real-life conditions. \n\n\n\n\t\u00a0\n\n\n\n\tFor example, they do not include the real-life pulsing and modulation of the carrier signal and do not reflect the real life exposures of various modulations. In addition, the vast majority of experiments do not account for synergistic adverse effects of other toxic stimuli with wireless radiation despite the reality that people are exposed to a myriad of toxic insults every day. Science has documented additive, synergistic, potentiative, and/or antagonistic effects created by the combination of exposures. Combined exposure to a toxic stimuli and wireless translates into much lower levels of tolerance for each toxic stimulus and the exposure limits for wireless radiation when examined in combination with other potentially toxic stimuli would be far lower for safety purposes than those derived from wireless radiation exposures in isolation.\n\n\n\n\t\u00a0\n\n\n\n\tThe authors contend that almost all of the wireless radiation laboratory experiments that have been performed to date are flawed/limited with respect to showing the full adverse impact of the wireless radiation that would be expected under real-life conditions because they did not include signal information and only used single stressors. The researchers conclude that in aggregate, for the high frequency (radiofrequency-RF) part of the spectrum, currently published reviews show that RF radiation below the FCC guidelines can result in: carcinogenicity (brain tumors/glioma, breast cancer, acoustic neuromas, leukemia, parotid gland tumors), genotoxicity (DNA damage, DNA repair inhibition, chromatin structure), mutagenicity, teratogenicity,\u00a0 neurodegenerative diseases (Alzheimer\u2019s Disease, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis), neurobehavioral problems, autism, reproductive problems, pregnancy outcomes, excessive reactive oxygen species/oxidative stress, inflammation, apoptosis, blood-brain barrier disruption, pineal gland/melatonin production, sleep disturbance, headache, irritability, fatigue, concentration difficulties, depression, dizziness, tinnitus, burning and flushed skin, digestive disturbance, tremor, cardiac irregularities, adverse impacts on the neural, circulatory, immune, endocrine, and skeletal systems\u201d and \u201cfrom this perspective, RF is a highly pervasive cause of disease\u201d (Kostoff et al., 2020)\n\n\n\n\t\u00a0\n\n\n\n\t\u201cTowards 5G communication systems: Are there health implications?\u201d is a research review detailing research findings that millimeter waves can alter gene expression, promote cellular proliferation and synthesis of proteins linked with oxidative stress, inflammatory and metabolic processes.\u201d The researchers conclude, \u201cavailable findings seem sufficient to demonstrate the existence of biomedical effects, to invoke the precautionary principle\u201d (Di Ciaula 2018).\n\n\n\n\t\u00a0\n\n\n\n\t\u201cSystematic Derivation of Safety Limits for Time-Varying 5G Radiofrequency Exposure Based on Analytical Models and Thermal\u00a0Dose\u201d documents how significant tissue heating can be generated by 5G technology\u2019s rapid short bursts of energy.\u00a0 \u201cThe results also show that the peak-to-average ratio of 1,000 tolerated by the International Council on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection guidelines may lead to permanent tissue damage after even short exposures, highlighting the importance of revisiting existing exposure guidelines.\u201d (Neufeld and Kuster 2018)\n\n\n\n\t\u00a0\n\n\n\n\t\u201cExposure of Insects to Radio-Frequency Electromagnetic Fields from 2 to 120\u2009GHz\u201d published in Scientific Reports is the first study to investigate how insects (including the Western honeybee) absorb the higher frequencies (2\u2009GHz to 120\u2009GHz) to be used in the 4G/5G rollout.

The heart and brain cancers found in the NTP rats are the same cell type as tumors that researchers have found to be\u00a0increased\u00a0in humans who have used cell phones for over 10 years.

In fact, all the RI Ramazzini radiation exposures were below FCC limits, as the study was specifically designed to test the safety of RF limits for cell tower/base stations (Falconi 2018.)

Researchers found elevated lymphoma and significantly higher numbers of tumors in the lungs and livers in the animals exposed to both RF and the carcinogen, leading researchers to state that previous research (Tillman 2010) was confirmed and that \u201cour results show that electromagnetic fields obviously enhance the growth of tumors\u201d (Lerchl 2015).\n\n\n\n\t\u00a0\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\tEnvironment\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\u201cA review of the ecological effects of RF-EMF\u201d reviewed 113 studies finding RF-EMF had a significant effect on birds, insects, other vertebrates, other organisms and plants in 70% of the studies (Cucurachi 2013). Development and reproduction in birds and insects were the most strongly affected.

They\u00a0 combined this information with with in-situ measurements of environmental RF-EMF exposure near beehives in Belgium in order to estimate o estimate a realistic exposure of honey bees at different developmental stages. The analysis shows that a relatively small shift of 10% of environmental incident power density from frequencies below 3\u2009GHz to higher frequencies will lead to a relative increase in absorbed power of a factor higher than 3. \u201cAssuming that 10% of the incident power density would shift to frequencies higher than 3\u2009GHz would lead to an increase of this absorption between 390\u2013570%.

Many antennas were dismantled.\n\n\n\n\t\u00a0\n\n\n\n\tA 2019\u00a0study\u00a0of students in schools near cell towers found their higher RF exposure was associated with impacts on motor skills, memory and attention (Meo 2019). Examples of other effects linked to cell towers in research studies include\u00a0neuropsychiatric problems,\u00a0elevated diabetes,\u00a0headaches,\u00a0sleep problems\u00a0and\u00a0genetic damage. Such research continues to accumulate after the 2010 landmark\u00a0review study\u00a0on 56 studies that reported biological effects found at very low intensities, including impacts on reproduction, permeability of the blood-brain barrier, behavior, cellular and metabolic changes, and increases in cancer risk (Lai and Levitt 2010).\n\n\n\n\t\u00a0\n\n\n\n\tA published study entitled, \u201cEffect of Mobile Tower Radiation on Microbial Diversity in Soil and Antibiotic Resistance\u201d\u00a0took soil samples \u00a0from four different base stations located in Dausa city, and control samples from soil far from stations and then isolated and evaluated the microorganisms in the soil. The researchers found greater antibiotic resistance in microbes present in soil near base stations compared to the control and a \u00a0statistical significant difference in pattern of antibiotic resistance was found with Nalidixic acid, and cefixime when used as antimicrobial agents. The study concludes, \u201cour findings suggest that mobile tower radiations can significantly alter the vital systems in microbes and turn them multidrug resistant (MDR) which is most important current threat to public health.\u201d\n\n\n\n\t\u00a0\n\n\n\n\tCellular Antennas Create Measurable Increases in Radiation in the Area\n\n\n\n\t\u00a0\n\n\n\n\tA\u00a02018 article\u00a0published in The Lancet Planetary Health points to unprecedented increasing RF exposures (Bandara and Carpenter 2018). Another key finding from\u00a0Zothansiama 2017\u00a0was that homes closer to antennas had measurably higher radiation levels\u2014adding to the documentation that antennas increase RF levels. An\u00a0Australian study\u00a0also found that children in kindergartens with nearby antenna installations had nearly three-and-a-half times higher RF exposures than children with installations further away (more than 300 meters (Bhatt 2016). \u00a0\n\n\n\n\t\u00a0\n\n\n\n\tResearch Finds that Cell Tower Base Station Radiation is the Dominant Contributor to Overall Environmental Radiation Exposures\n\n\n\n\t\u00a0\n\n\n\n\tA 2018 multi-country\u00a0study\u00a0that measured RF in several countries found that cell phone tower radiation is the dominant contributor to RF exposure in most outdoor areas exposure in urban areas was higher and that exposure has drastically increased. As an example, the measurements the researchers took in Los Angeles,\u00a0USA were 70 times higher than the US EPA estimate 40 years ago\u00a0(Sagar 2018).\n\n\n\n\t\u00a0\n\n\n\n\tAs an example of how rapidly RF is increasing from wireless antennas, a\u00a02014 published study\u00a0looked at RF in three European cities and found in just one year (between \u00a0April 2011 and March 2012) that the total RF-EMF exposure levels in all outdoor areas in combination increased by 57.1% \u00a0in Basel by 20.1% in Ghent and by 38.2% in Brussels (Urbinello 2014). \u201cExposure increase was most consistently observed in outdoor areas due to emissions from mobile phone base stations.\u201d \u00a0\n\n\n\n\t\u00a0\n\n\n\n\tAnother study,\u00a0Birks 2018, looked at 529 children in Denmark, the Netherlands, Slovenia, Switzerland and Spain who wore meters around the waist or carried in a backpack during the day and placed close to the bed at night. Researchers \u00a0found \u201cthe largest contributors to total personal environmental RF-EMF exposure were downlink (meaning from cell tower base stations) and broadcast.\u201d\n\n\n\n\t\u00a0\n\n\n\n\tA study on Australian adults where participants carried a measuring device in a small hip bag for approximately 24 consecutive hours also found \u201cdownlink and broadcast are the main contributors to total RF-EMF personal exposure.\u201d Downlink (RF from mobile phone base station) contributed 40.4% of the total RF-EMF exposure (Zeleke 2018).\n\n\n\n\t\u00a0\n\n\n\n\tAnother published study (Choi 2018) that gave 50 Korean adult child pairs a special radiation measuring device for 48 hours evaluated the types of radiation the participants were exposed to and found that \u201cthe contribution of base-station exposure to total RF-EMF exposure was the highest both in parents and children.\u201d These two studies are an important example of the research that shows that radiation from base stations is the dominant contributor to a person\u2019s cumulative exposure. Therefore we cannot only focus on a persons cell phone use as the way people are exposed to this radiation. People are exposed to wireless radiation even when they are not using a mobile device due to cell towers, antennas and hotspots and they have no control over this. \u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\u201cOn the horizon, a new generation of even shorter high frequency 5G wavelengths is being proposed to power the Internet of Things (IoT).\u201d\n\t \n\t\n\t\t\u201cIt is argued that the addition of this added high frequency 5G radiation to an already complex mix of lower frequencies, will contribute to a negative public health outcome both from both physical and mental health perspectives.\u201d\n\t \n\t\n\t\t\u201cLike other common toxic exposures, the effects of radiofrequency electromagnetic radiation (RF EMR) will be problematic if not impossible to sort out epidemiologically as there no longer remains an unexposed control group. This is especially important considering these effects are likely magnified by synergistic toxic exposures and other common health risk behaviors. Effects can also be non-linear. Because this is the first generation to have cradle-to-grave lifespan exposure to this level of man-made microwave (RF EMR) radiofrequencies, it will be years or decades before the true health consequences are known. Precaution in the roll out of this new technology is strongly indicated.\u201d\n\t \n\t\n\t\t\u201cCurrent radiofrequency radiation wavelengths we are exposed to appear to act as a toxin to biological systems. A moratorium on the deployment of 5G is warranted, along with development of independent health and environmental advisory boards that include independent scientists who research biological effects and exposure levels of radiofrequency radiation. Sound regulatory policy regarding current and future telecommunications initiative will require more careful assessment of risks to human health, environmental health, public safety, privacy, security and social consequences. Public health regulations need to be updated to match appropriate independent science with the adoption of biologically based exposure standards prior to further deployment of 4G or 5G technology.\u201d\n\t \n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\tExperimentally we showed that the reflectance of the human skin in the sub-THz region depends on the intensity of perspiration, i.e. sweat duct\u2019s conductivity, and correlates with levels of human stress (physical, mental and emotional). Later on, we detected circular dichroism in the reflectance from the skin, a signature of the axial mode of a helical antenna. The full ramifications of what these findings represent in the human condition are still unclear. We also revealed correlation of electrocardiography (ECG) parameters to the sub-THz reflection coefficient of human skin. In a recent work, we developed a unique simulation tool of human skin, taking into account the skin multi-layer structure together with the helical segment of the sweat duct embedded in it. The presence of the sweat duct led to a high specific absorption rate (SAR) of the skin in extremely high frequency band.\n\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t\tIn this paper, we summarize the physical evidence for this phenomenon and consider its implication for the future exploitation of the electromagnetic spectrum by wireless communication. Starting from July 2016 the US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has adopted new rules for wireless broadband operations above 24\u202fGHz (5\u202fG). This trend of exploitation is predicted to expand to higher frequencies in the sub-THz region. One must consider the implications of human immersion in the electromagnetic noise, caused by devices working at the very same frequencies as those, to which the sweat duct (as a helical antenna) is most attuned.\n\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t\tWe are raising a warning flag against the unrestricted use of sub-THz technologies for communication, before the possible consequences for public health are explored.\n\t\t \n\t\n\n\n\t\t\tExcerpts from abstract: \u201cInsects are continually exposed to Radio-Frequency (RF) electromagnetic fields at different frequencies. This paper is the first to report the absorbed RF electromagnetic power in four different types of insects as a function of frequency from 2\u2009GHz to 120\u2009GHz. A set of insect models was obtained using novel Micro-CT (computer tomography) imaging. These models were used for the first time in finite-difference time-domain electromagnetic simulations. All insects showed a dependence of the absorbed power on the frequency. All insects showed a general increase in absorbed RF power at and above 6\u2009GHz, in comparison to the absorbed RF power below 6\u2009GHz. Our simulations showed that a shift of 10% of the incident power density to frequencies above 6\u2009GHz would lead to an increase in absorbed power between 3\u2013370%.\u201d\n\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t\t\u201cThis could lead to changes in insect behaviour, physiology, and morphology over time due to an increase in body temperatures, from dielectric heating. The studied insects that are smaller than 1 cm show a peak in absorption at frequencies (above 6GHz), which are currently not often used for telecommunication, but are planned to be used in the next generation of wireless telecommunication systems.\u201d\n\t\t \n\t\n\n\n\n\t\u2022 Increased risk of brain, vestibular nerve and salivary gland tumors are associated with mobile phone use.\n\t\u2022 Nine studies (2011\u20132017) report increased risk of brain cancer from mobile phone use.\n\t\u2022 Four case-control studies (3 in 2013, 1 in 2014) report increased risk of vestibular nerve tumors.\n\t\u2022 Concern for other cancers: breast (male \u0026amp; female), testis, leukemia, and thyroid.\n\t\u2022 Based on the evidence reviewed it is our opinion that IARC\u2019s current categorization of RFR as a possible human carcinogen (Group 2B) should be upgraded to Carcinogenic to Humans (Group 1).\n\n\n\n\n\t\tIn 2008, we demonstrated that the coiled portion of the sweat duct in upper skin layer could be regarded as a helical antenna in the sub-THz band. The full ramifications of what these findings represent in the human condition are still very unclear,\u00a0but it is obvious that the absorption of electromagnetic energy is governed by the topology for the skin and its organelles, especially the sweat duct.\n\t \n\n\n\n\t\t\u201cPreliminary observations showed that MMW increase skin temperature, alter gene expression, promote cellular proliferation and synthesis of proteins linked with oxidative stress, inflammatory and metabolic processes, could generate ocular damages, affect neuro-muscular dynamics.\u201d\n\t \n\t\n\t\t\u201cFurther studies are needed to better and independently explore the health effects of RF-EMF in general and of MMW in particular. However, available findings seem sufficient to demonstrate the existence of biomedical effects, to invoke the precautionary principle, to define exposed subjects as potentially vulnerable and to revise existing limits.\n\t \n\n\n\n\t\t\u201cPrior research on human exposure to radio frequency (RF) fields in a cellular communications system has been focused on uplink only due to the closer physical contact of a transmitter to a human body. However, this paper claims the necessity of thorough investigation on human exposure to downlink RF fields, as cellular systems deployed in mmW bands will entail (i) deployment of more transmitters due to smaller cell size and (ii) higher concentration of RF energy using a highly directional antenna.\n\t \n\t\n\t\tIn this paper, we present human RF exposure levels in downlink of a Fifth Generation Wireless Systems (5G). Our results show that 5G downlink RF fields generate significantly higher power density (PD) and specific absorption rate (SAR) than a current cellular system. This paper also shows that SAR should also be taken into account for determining human RF exposure in the mmW downlink.\u201d\n\t \n\n\n\n\t\t\u201cthis report represents the first metabolomic investigation focusing on the effects of MMW.\u201d\n\t \n\t\n\t\t\u201cit is reasonable to assume that the vast amount of dysregulations reported in these sequences do not stem from alterations of gene expression but rather from alterations in membrane permeability, consistently with previous reports on acellular phospholipidic systems. \u201c\n\t \n\t\n\t\t\u201cfurther studies will be necessary to assess MMW bioeffects on animal models and to investigate potential dysregulations induced by lower IPD values prior to the wide-scale deployment of technologies based on these specific frequencies.\u201d\n\t \n\t\n\t\t\u201cThis unexpected extent of modifications can hardly stem from the mild changes that could be reported throughout transcriptomics studies, leading us to hypothesize that MMW might alter the permeability of cell membranes, as reported elsewhere.\u201d\n\t \n\n\n\n\t\tMillimeter Waves (MMW) will be used in the next-generation of high-speed wireless technologies, especially in future Ultra-Broadband small cells in 5G cellular networks. Therefore, their biocompatibilities must be evaluated prior to their massive deployment. Using a microarray-based approach, we analyzed modifications to the whole genome of a human keratinocyte model that was exposed at 60.4 GHz-MMW at an incident power density (IPD) of 20 mW/cm2\u00a0for 3 hours in athermic conditions. No keratinocyte transcriptome modifications were observed. We tested the effects of MMWs on cell metabolism by co-treating MMW-exposed cells with a glycolysis inhibitor, 2-deoxyglucose (2dG, 20 mM for 3 hours), and whole genome expression was evaluated along with the ATP content. We found that the 2dG treatment decreased the cellular ATP content and induced a high modification in the transcriptome (632 coding genes). The affected genes were associated with transcriptional repression, cellular communication and endoplasmic reticulum homeostasis. The MMW/2dG co-treatment did not alter the keratinocyte ATP content, but it did slightly alter the transcriptome, which reflected the capacity of MMW to interfere with the bioenergetic stress response. The RT-PCR-based validation confirmed 6 MMW-sensitive genes (SOCS3,\u00a0SPRY2,\u00a0TRIB1,\u00a0FAM46A,\u00a0CSRNP1\u00a0and\u00a0PPP1R15A) during the 2dG treatment. These 6 genes encoded transcription factors or inhibitors of cytokine pathways, which raised questions regarding the potential impact of long-term or chronic MMW exposure on metabolically stressed cells.\n\t \n\n\n\n\t\tAbstract: Over the next years the demand of wireless communication will increase tremendously. More and more mobile end devices require a high data rate connection e.g. to a smart home (Internet of Things, IoT) or to the internet. The radiation power pattern of base stations and mobile end devices will completely change for the 5G Next Generation Mobile Network technology which will use frequency bands up to 100 GHz. Therefore the electromagnetic exposure especially to human body will increase in the future, because most of the wireless connections are realized in RF technology. In this contribution two different measurement setups are presented. The first shows the electromagnetic radiation regarding a base station powered by a mobile phone provider over a timespan of a number of days. The second figures out the electromagnetic radiation of a handheld mobile end device to a human head in an area with very poor reception values. The results of those measurements where compared with legal and health limits. All measured and calculated results regarding the base stations were within the legal exposure limits. The calculated legal exposure limits of mobile devices were exceeded twice in areas within very poor reception values. Regarding the expected higher bandwidth and corresponding higher electromagnetic exposure to human bodies in future there have to be periodic measurements to comply with radiation limits.\n\t \n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tExcerpts: \u201cRegarding the above mentioned circumstances\u00a0it will be necessary to measure the radiation exposure of base stations in the future on a regular basis in order to ensure the legal limits and to reduce possible health hazards. It also will be necessary to develop new measurement strategies and/or technologies regarding the large frequency spectrum 5G will use up to 100 GHz. \u2026When measuring directly on a mobile phone (simulating the use of an end device directly on the human head), it was found that the calculated SAR of 3.834\u00a0W/kg\u00a0exceeds the legal limit of 2 W/ kg. This shows clearly that the legal limit values can be exceeded significantly in areas with very poor reception values \u2026Increasing the distance between a mobile end device and the head, e.g. by using a hands-free set or a headset can significantly reduce the human exposure to electromagnetic radiation when such a device is used in badly supplied areas and transmits with maximum power.\u201d\n\t\t\n\t \n\n\n\tExtreme broadband wireless devices operating above 10 GHz may transmit data in bursts of a few milliseconds to seconds. Even though the time- and area-averaged power density values remain within the acceptable safety limits for continuous exposure,\u00a0these bursts may lead to short temperature spikes in the skin of exposed people.\n\n\n\n\n\t\tThis result indicates that careful consideration should be given while designing electronic and photonic devices operating in the sub-terahertz frequency region in order to avoid various effects on human health due to these waves.\n\t \n\n\n\n\t\t\u201cMorphological, functional and biochemical studies conducted in humans and animals revealed that millimeterwave caused changes in the body manifested in structural alterations in the skin and internal organs, qualitative and quantitative changes of the blood and bone marrow composition and changes of the conditioned reflex activity, tissue respiration, activity of enzymes participating in the process of tissue respiration and nucleic metabolism. The degree of unfavorable effect of millimeterwave depended on the duration of the radiation and individual characteristics of the organism.\u201d\n\t \n\n\n\n\t\t\u201cThis paper analyzes general trends in the area and briefly reviews the most significant publications, proceeding from cell-free systems, dosimetry, and spectroscopy issues through cultured cells and isolated organs to animals and humans.\n\t \n\t\n\t\tThe studies reviewed demonstrate effects of low-intensity MMW (10 mW/cm2 and less) on cell growth and proliferation, activity of enzymes, state of cell genetic apparatus, function of excitable membranes, peripheral receptors, and other biological systems. In animals and humans, local MMW exposure stimulated tissue repair and regeneration, alleviated stress reactions, and facilitated recovery in a wide range of diseases (MMW therapy). Many reported MMW effects could not be readily explained by temperature changes during irradiation.\u201d\n\t \n\t\n\t\tFull paper in draft form\u00a0 is online as\u00a0CURRENT STATE AND IMPLICATIONS OF RESEARCH ON BIOLOGICAL EFFECTS OF MILLIMETER WAVES: A REVIEW OF LITERATURE\u00a0CURRENT STATE AND IMPLICATIONS OF RESEARCH ON BIOLOGICAL EFFECTS OF MILLIMETER WAVES: A REVIEW OF LITERATURE\u00a0Andrei G.

Army Medical Research Detachment of the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (B.E.S.), and Directed Energy Bioeffects Division, Human Effectiveness Directorate, Air Force Research Laboratory (M.R.M.), Brooks Air Force Base, San Antonio, TX\n\t \n\t\n\t\t\u201cIt is important to note that, even with the variety of bioeffects reported, no studies have provided evidence that a low-intensity MMW radiation represents a health hazard for human beings. Actually, none of the reviewed studies with low-intensity MMW even pursued the evaluation of health risks, though in view of numerous bioeffects and growing usage of MMW technologies this research objective appears very reasonable. Such MMW effects as alterations of cell growth rate and UV light sensitivity, biochemical and antibiotic resistivity changes in pathogenic bacteria, as well as many others are of potential significance for safety standards. MMW therapy in many cases employs field intensities comparable to or lower than allowed by current safety standards; still, even local and short-term exposures were reported to produce marked effects. It should also be realized that biological effects of a prolonged or chronic MMW exposure of the whole body or a large body area have never been investigated. Safety limits for these types of exposure are based solely on predictions of energy deposition and MMW heating, but in view of recent studies this approach is not necessarily adequate.\u201d\n\t \n\n\n\n\t\tThis paper gives examples of today\u2019s regulatory requirements, and provides an example for a 60 GHz transceiver. Also, the propagation characteristics of millimeter-waves in the presence of the human body are studied, and four models representing different body parts are considered to evaluate thermal effects of millimeter-wave radiation on the body. Simulation results show that about 34% to 42% of the incident power is reflected at the skin surface at 60 GHz. This paper shows that power density is not suitable to determine exposure compliance when millimeter wave devices are used very close to the body. A temperature-based technique for the evaluation of safety compliance is proposed in this paper.\n\t \n\n\n\t\u201cA\u00a0 literature survey representing the most recent available results related to the biological effects of mmWave exposure, from the well-understood and well-accepted effects of thermal heating to recent reports of nonthermal effects and the attempt to motivate further discussion and research for appropriate emission standards.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\u201cWe highlighted the findings of mmWave radiation studies on the eyes and skin since, in communication applications, these tissues would receive the most radiation, with other tissues receiving, by comparison, a negligible amount. Ocular injury can be induced by short-term high-intensity exposure (e.g., 2,000 mW/cm2, 1.5\u20135 s) far beyond the anticipated future communication device levels, but the eyes do not appear to suffer damage from longer low-intensity exposure (e.g., 10 mW/cm2, 8 h), which might be experienced from mmWave communication technologies in the far field.\n\t \n\t\n\t\tMore work may be required to determine the possible effects from exposure above 10 mW/cm2\u00a0that might be experienced in the near field from specific communication devices with adaptive antennas as well as to ensure that mechanisms are in place to ensure that no hazardous levels of energy are transmitted into the eyes. We also showed that using typical power levels, there would be no unsafe temperature increase caused by exposure of skin to mmWave communication technologies in the far field.\n\t \n\t\n\t\tAs with the eyes, however, more work is required to determine temperature increases from higher exposure levels that might be experienced in the near field from specific communication devices with high-gain antennas and to develop and demonstrate reliable mechanisms to ensure that no hazardous levels of energy are transmitted to the skin.\u201d\n\t \n\n\n\n\t\tThe millimeter waves (MMW) region of the electromagnetic spectrum, extending from 30 to 300 GHz in terms of frequency (corresponding to wavelengths from 10 mm to 1 mm), is officially used in non-invasive complementary medicine in many Eastern European countries against a variety of diseases such gastro duodenal ulcers, cardiovascular disorders, traumatism and tumor. On the other hand, besides technological applications in traffic and military systems, in the near future MMW will also find applications in high resolution and high-speed wireless communication technology. This has led to restoring interest in research on MMW induced biological effects. In this review emphasis has been given to the MMW-induced effects on cell membranes that are considered the major target for the interaction between MMW and biological systems.\n\t \n\n\n\tScientific Citations from the published study \u201cPotential Risks to Human Health Originating from Future Sub-MM Communication Systems\u201d\u00a0 by Paul Ben-Ishai, PhD and Yuri Feldman, PhD\n\n\n\n\n\t\tFeldman, Yuri and Paul Ben-Ishai.\u00a0\u201cPotential Risks to Human Health Originating from Future Sub-MM Communication Systems.\u201d\u00a0Abstract, 2017.\n\t \n\t\n\t\tFeldman, Yuri, et al.\u00a0\u201cHuman skin as arrays of helical antennas in the millimeter and submillimeter wave range.\u201d\u00a0Physical Review Letters, vol. 100, no. 12, 2008.\n\t \n\t\n\t\tHayut, Itai, et al.\u00a0\u201cCircular polarization induced by the three-dimensional chiral structure of human sweat ducts.\u201d\u00a0Physical Review, vol. 89, no. 4, 2014.\n\t \n\t\n\t\tHayut, Itai, et al.\u00a0\u201cThe Helical Structure of Sweat Ducts: Their Influence on the Electromagnetic Reflection Spectrum of the Skin.\u201d\u00a0IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology, vol. 3, no. 2, 2013, pp. \u00a0207-15.\n\t \n\t\n\t\tProfessor Yuri Feldman \u2013\u00a0Research Study Summaries, The Hebrew University of Jerusalem Department of Applied Physics, Dielectric Spectroscopy Laboratory\n\t \n\t\n\t\t\u00a0\n\t \n\n\n\tRESEARCH ON MILLIMETER WAVES\n\n\n\n\t\u00a0\n\n\n\n\tGene expression changes in the skin of rats induced by prolonged 35 GHz millimeter-wave exposure.

In large studies, an association has been observed between symptoms and exposure to these fields in the everyday environment.\u201d\n\n\n\n\tCompilation of Research Studies on Cell Tower Radiation and Health\n\n\n\n\n\t\tThis study evaluated effects in the human blood of individuals living near mobile phone base stations (within 80 meters) compared with healthy controls (over 300 meters). The study found higher radiofrequency radiation exposures and statistically significant differences in the blood of people living closer to the cellular antennas. The \u00a0group living closer to the antennas had for example, statistically significant higher frequency of micronuclei and a rise in lipid peroxidation in their blood. These changes are considered biomarkers predictive of cancer.\n\t \n\n\n\n\t\tThis study found that living nearby mobile phone base stations (cell antennas) increased the risk for neuropsychiatric problems such as headaches, memory problems, dizziness, tremors,depression, sleep problems and some changes in the performance of neurobehavioral functions. \u00a0\n\t \n\n\n\n\t\tThis review of 100 studies found approximately 80% showed biological effects near towers. \u201cBoth anecdotal reports and some epidemiology studies have found headaches, skin rashes, sleep disturbances, depression, decreased libido, increased rates of suicide, concentration problems, dizziness, memory changes, increased risk of cancer, tremors, and other neurophysiological effects in populations near base stations.\u201d \u00a0\n\t \n\n\n\n\t\tThis 10 year study on cell phone antennas by the Municipal Health Department in Belo Horizonte and several universities in Brazil found a clearly elevated relative risk of cancer mortality at residential distances of 500 meters or less from cell phone transmission towers. Shortly after this study was published, the city prosecutor sued several cell phone companies and requested that almost half of the cities antennas be removed. Many antennas were dismantled.\n\t \n\n\n\n\t\tA review of 10 epidemiological studies that assessed for negative health effects of mobile phone base stations (4 studies were from Germany, and 1 each from Austria, Egypt, France, Israel, Poland, Spain) found that seven showed altered neurobehavioral effects near cell tower and three showed increased cancer incidence. The review also found that eight of the 10 studies reported increased prevalence of adverse neurobehavioral symptoms or cancer in populations living at distances \u0026lt; 500 meters from base stations. Lower cognitive performance was found in \u00a0individuals living \u2264 10 meters from base stations. None of the studies reported exposure above accepted international guidelines, suggesting that current guidelines may be inadequate in protecting the health of human populations.\n\t \n\n\n\n\t\tThis \u00a0cross-sectional study found the symptoms of nausea, headache, dizziness, irritability, discomfort, nervousness, depression, sleep disturbance, memory loss and lowering of libido were statistically increased in people living closer than 300\u2009m from cell antennas as compared to those living farther away. The study concludes that \u201cantennas should not be sited closer than 300\u2009m to people to minimize exposure.\u201d\n\t \n\n\n\n\t\tEven a year of operation of a powerful base transmitting station for mobile communication reportedly resulted in a dramatic increase of cancer incidence among population living nearby. \u00a0\n\t \n\n\n\n\t\tElementary school students who were exposed to high RF-EMFR generated by MPBS had a significantly higher risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus relative to their counterparts who were exposed to lower RF-EMFR. \u00a0\n\t \n\n\n\n\t\tRFR exposures significantly impacted ACTH, cortisol, thyroid hormones, prolactin for \u00a0females, and testosterone levels for males.\n\t \n\n\n\n\t\tPeople living near mobile phone masts reported more symptoms of headache, sleep disturbance, discomfort, irritability, depression, memory loss and concentration problems the closer they lived to the installation. \u00a0Study authors recommend that the minimal distance of people from cellular phone base stations should not be \u0026lt; 300 m.\n\t \n\n\n\tNavarro EA, Segura J, Portoles M, Gomez-Perretta C,\u00a0The Microwave Syndrome: A preliminary Study. 2003 (Spain) Electromagnetic Biology and Medicine, Volume 22, Issue 2, (2003): 161 \u2013 169\n\n\n\n\n\t\tStatistically significant positive exposure-response associations between RFR intensity and fatigue, irritability, headaches, nausea, loss of appetite, sleeping disorder, depressive tendency, feeling of discomfort, difficulty in concentration, loss of memory, visual disorder, dizziness and cardiovascular problems. \u00a0\n\t \n\n\n\tTwo Important Animal Studies on Radiofrequency Radiation\n\n\n\n\tThese studies indicate that government limits are non protective. Government limits are based on the assumption that radiofrequency radiation is only harmful at thermal levels. However, the cancers developed in animals in these studies at radiation levels that were non thermal.\n\n\n\n\n\t\tResearchers with the renowned Ramazzini Institute (RI) in Italy performed a large-scale lifetime\u00a0study\u00a0of lab animals exposed to environmental levels (comparable to allowable limits from cell towers) of RFR radiation and found the rats developed increased cancers- schwannoma of the heart in male rats. This study confirms the $25 million\u00a0US National Toxicology Program\u00a0study which used much higher levels of cell phone radiofrequency (RF) radiation, but also reported finding the same unusual cancers as the Ramazzini- schwannoma of the heart in male rats. In addition, the RI study of cell tower radiation also found increases in malignant brain (glial) tumors in female rats and precancerous conditions including Schwann cells hyperplasia in both male and female rats.\n\t \n\t\n\t\t\u201cOur findings of cancerous tumors in rats exposed to environmental levels of RF are consistent with and reinforce the results of the US NTP studies on cell phone radiation, as both reported increases in the same types of tumors of the brain and heart in Sprague-Dawley rats. Together, these studies provide sufficient evidence to call for the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) to re-evaluate and re-classify their conclusions regarding the carcinogenic potential of RFR in humans,\u201d said Fiorella Belpoggi PhD, study author and RI Director of Research.\n\t \n\t\n\t\tThe Ramazzini study exposed 2448 Sprague-Dawley rats from prenatal life until their natural death to \u201cenvironmental\u201d cell tower radiation for 19 hours per day (1.8 GHz GSM radiofrequency radiation (RFR) of 5, 25 and 50 V/m). RI exposures mimicked base station emissions like those from cell tower antennas, and exposure levels were far less than those used in the NTP studies of cell phone radiation.\n\t \n\t\n\t\tWatch Press Conference\n\t \n\n\n\n\t\tThis 25 million dollar study is the most complex study completed by the NTP and the world\u2019s largest rodent study on radiofrequency radiation exposure to date which found long term exposure at non thermal levels associated with brain cancer and schwannomas of the heart in male rats. In addition damage to heart was found in all exposure levels. The full report is expected to be released in Fall 2018.\n\t \n\n\n\tMore Important Studies on Cell Tower Radiation \u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\t\tRadiofrequency radiation (RF) is increasingly being recognized as a new form of\u00a0environmental pollution. \u00a0This article \u00a0reviews relevant\u00a0electromagnetic\u00a0frequencies, exposure standards and current scientific literature on the health implications of 2G, 3G, 4G and 5G.\n\t \n\t\n\t\tEffects can also be non-linear. Because this is the first generation to have cradle-to-grave lifespan exposure to this level of man-made microwave (RF EMR) radiofrequencies, it will be years or decades before the true health consequences are known. Precaution in the roll out of this new technology is strongly indicated.\n\t \n\n\n\n\t\tResearchers have developed a unique simulation tool of human skin, taking into account the skin\u00a0multi-layer structure\u00a0together with the helical segment of the sweat duct embedded in it. They found that the presence of the sweat duct led to a high specific absorption rate (SAR) of the skin in\u00a0extremely high frequency\u00a0band that will be used in 5G. \u201cOne must consider the implications of human immersion in the electromagnetic noise, caused by devices working at the very same frequencies as those, to which the sweat duct (as a helical antenna) is most attuned. We are raising a warning flag against the unrestricted use of sub-THz technologies for communication, before the possible consequences for public health are explored.\u201d\n\t \n\n\n\n\t\tThis article was published in Environmental Science \u0026amp; Policy by human rights experts. It argues that cell tower placement is a human rights issue for children.\n\t \n\t\n\t\t\u201cWe argue that (1) because protection of children is a high threshold norm in Human Right \u00a0law and (2) the binding language of the Convention on the Rights of the Child obliges States Parties to provide a higher standard of protection for children than adults, any widespread or systematic form of environmental pollution that poses a long-term threat to a child\u2019s rights to life, development or health may constitute an international human rights violation.\n\t \n\t\n\t\tIn particular we have explained how the dearth of legislation to regulate the installation of base stations \u00a0(cell towers) in close proximity to children\u2019s facilities and schools clearly constitutes a human rights concern according to the language of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, a treaty that has been ratified by all European States.\n\t \n\n\n\n\t\tThis research looked at the radiation that cell towers emit and states a safety zone is needed around the towers to ensure safe sleeping areas. The authors state that \u201crespective authorities should ensure that people reside far from the tower by 120m or more depending on the power transmitted to avoid severe health effect.\u201d\n\t \n\n\n\n\t\tThis cross-sectional case control study on genetic damage in individuals living near cell towers found genetic damage parameters of DNA were significantly elevated. The authors state,\u201d The genetic damage evident in the participants of this study needs to be addressed against future disease-risk, which in addition to neurodegenerative disorders, may lead to cancer.\u201d\n\t \n\n\n\n\t\tThis review summarizes the evidence stating that excessive exposure to magnetic fields from power lines and other sources of electric current increases the risk of development of some cancers and neurodegenerative diseases, and that excessive exposure to RF radiation increases risk of cancer, male infertility, and neurobehavioral abnormalities.\n\t \n\n\n\n\t\tJapanese study Showed Statistically Significant Adverse Health Effects from electromagnetic radiation from mobile phone base stations. Residents of a condominium building that had cell tower antennas on the rooftop were examined before and after cell tower antennas were removed. In 1998, 800MHz cell antennas were installed, then later in 2008 a second set of antennas (2GHz) were installed. \u00a0Medical exams and interviews were conducted before and after the antennas were removed in 2009 on 107 residents of the building who had no prior knowledge about possible. These results lead researchers to question the construction of mobile phone base stations on top of buildings such as condominiums or houses.\n\t \n\n\n\n\t\tIn our study, 116 persons exposed to radiation from mobile towers and 106 control subjects were genotyped for polymorphisms in the GSTM1 and GSTT1 genes by multiplex polymerase chain reaction method. DNA damage in peripheral blood lymphocytes was determined using alkaline comet assay in terms of tail moment (TM) value and micronucleus assay in buccal cells (BMN). Our results indicated that TM value and BMN frequency were higher in an exposed population compared with a control group and the difference is significant. In our study, we found that different health symptoms, such as depression, memory status, insomnia, and hair loss, were significantly associated with exposure to EMR. Damaging effects of nonionizing radiation result from the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and subsequent radical formation and from direct damage to cellular macromolecules including DNA.\n\t \n\n\n\n\t\tFound a significant relationship between some cognitive symptoms and measured power density in 365 subjects; highest for headaches. Perceptual speed increased, while accuracy decreased insignificantly with increasing exposure levels.\n\t \n\n\n\n\t\tA health survey was carried out in La \u00d1ora, Murcia, Spain, in the vicinity of two GSM 900/1800 MHz cellular phone base stations. The adjusted (sex, age, distance) logistic regression model showed statistically significant positive exposure-response associations between the E-field and the following variables: fatigue, irritability, headaches, nausea, loss of appetite, sleeping disorder, depressive tendency, feeling of discomfort, difficulty in concentration, loss of memory, visual disorder, dizziness and cardiovascular problems.\n\t \n\n\n\n\t\tResidents close to mobile phone masts reported: more incidences of circulatory problems, sleep disturbances, irritability, depression, blurred vision and concentration difficulties the nearer they lived to the mast.\n\t \n\t\n\t\tThe performed studies showed the relationship between the incidence of individual symptoms, the level of exposure, and the distance between a residential area and a base station.\n\t \n\n\n\n\t\tA significant higher rate of cancer (300% increase) among all residents living within 300m radius of a mobile phone mast for between three and seven years was detected.\n\t \n\t\n\t\t900% cancer increase among women alone\n\t \n\t\n\t\tIn the area of exposure (area A) eight cases of different kinds of cancer were diagnosed in a period of only one year. This rate of cancers was compared both with the rate of 31 cases per 10,000 per year in the general population and the 2/1222 rate recorded in the nearby clinic (area B). The study indicates an association between increased incidence of cancer and living in proximity to a cell-phone transmitter station.\n\t \n\n\n\n\t\tGerman study showing elevated levels of stress hormones (adrenaline, noradrenaline), and lowered dopamine and PEA levels in urine in area residents during 1st 6 months of cell tower installation. Even after 1.5 years, the levels did not return to normal.\n\t \n\n\n\n\t\t200% increase in the incidence of malignant tumors was found after five years\u2019 exposure in people living within 400m radius of a mobile phone mast. The proportion of newly developing cancer cases is significantly higher among patients who live within 400 meters of a cell phone transmitter. Early age of cancer diagnosis.\n\t \n\n\n\n\t\t\u201cIt can be seen from the above that 10 different well-documented microwave EMF effects can be easily explained as being a consequence of EMF VGCC activation: oxidative stress, elevated single and double strand breaks in DNA, therapeutic responses to such EMFs, breakdown of the blood-brain barrier, cancer, melatonin loss, sleep dysfunction, male infertility and female infertility.\u201d\n\t \n\n\n\n\t\tNon-thermal microwave/lower frequency electromagnetic fields (EMFs) act via voltage-gated calcium channel (VGCC) activation.\n\t \n\t\n\t\tTwo U.S. government reports from the 1970s to 1980s provide evidence for many neuropsychiatric effects of non-thermal microwave EMFs, based on occupational exposure studies. 18 more recent epidemiological studies, provide substantial evidence that microwave EMFs from cell/mobile phone base stations, excessive cell/mobile phone usage and from wireless smart meters can each produce similar patterns of neuropsychiatric effects, with several of these studies showing clear dose\u2013response relationships.\n\t \n\t\n\t\tLesser evidence from 6 additional studies suggests that short wave, radio station, occupational and digital TV antenna exposures may produce similar neuropsychiatric effects. Among the more commonly reported changes are sleep disturbance/insomnia, headache, depression/depressive symptoms, fatigue/tiredness, dysesthesia, concentration/attention dysfunction, memory changes, dizziness, irritability, loss of appetite/body weight, restlessness/anxiety, nausea, skin burning/tingling/dermographism and EEG changes. In summary, then, the mechanism of action of microwave EMFs, the role of the VGCCs in the brain, the impact of non-thermal EMFs on the brain, extensive epidemiological studies performed over the past 50 years, and five criteria testing for causality, all collectively show that various non-thermal microwave EMF exposures produce diverse neuropsychiatric effects.\n\t \n\n\n\t\u00a0\n\n",

            "text": "Protect yourself from dangerous EMF radiations: Nature\u0027s solution to 5G, 4G, Small Cells and wireless radiation\n\t\n\t\tPublished Scientific Research on 5G, Small Cells\u00a0 Wireless and Health\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\u00a0\n\t\n\n\n\n\tPublished peer reviewed science already indicates that the current wireless technologies of 2G, 3G and 4G \u2013 in use today with our cell phones, computers and wearable tech \u2013 creates (create) radiofrequency exposures which poses (pose) a serious health risk to humans, animals and the environment. Scientists are cautioning that before rolling out 5G, research on human health effects urgently needs to be done first\u00a0 to ensure the public and environment are protected.\n\n\n\n\t\u00a0\n\n\n\n\t\u201cSmall cells\u201d are microwave antennas (basicallyshorter cell towers) rapidly being installed in public areas on utility poles and street lights in front of homes, parks and schools. Just like cell towers, these wireless antennas generate and emit microwave radiofrequency (RF) radiation to transmit 2G, 3G and 4G network signals. Companies soon plan to add a new technology called 5G which will use current 4G technology plus even higher frequencies. The higher frequencies include millimeter-wave emissions that were not previously released into public areas.\n\n\n\n\t\u00a0\n\n\n\n\tCompanies state that these\u00a04G\u00a0and\u00a05G\u00a0antennas will\u00a0increase\u00a0the wireless radiation levels in the area so much that they are working to loosen several governments\u2019 radiation limits in order to roll it out. More than 240 scientists\u00a0published\u00a0an appeal to the United Nations to reduce public exposure and called for a\u00a0moratorium on 5G\u00a0citing \u201cestablished\u201d adverse biological effects of RF radiation.\n\n\n\n\t\u00a0\n\n\n\n\t5G will utilize not only the frequencies currently in use, but also higher millimeter wave and sub-millimeter wave frequencies. Small cells being installed in cities are usually 4G technology with a wide variety of frequencies. Thus, when we consider the health impacts of 5G and small cells we are looking at research on current technologies and frequencies in use in addition to research on sub-millimeter and millimeter waves.\u00a0The 5G standard is new\u00a0 there are no studies that have looked at long term human exposure to 5G. However the current body of research finding effects from current wireless technology provides enough data for scientists to call for a moratorium.\n\n\n\n\t\u00a0\n\n\n\n\tThis page lists a small sampling of research on 5G, millimeter waves, cellular antennas, the environment and human health.\n\n\n\n\t\u201c5G Wireless Expansion: Public Health and Environmental Implications\u201d is a research review that documents the range of reported adverse effects of RF and millimeter waves\u2014effects range from cancer to bacteria growth changes to DNA damage. The study concludes that \u201ca moratorium on the deployment of 5G is warranted\u201d and \u201cthe addition of this added high frequency 5G radiation to an already complex mix of lower frequencies, will contribute to a negative public health outcome \u2026 from both physical and mental health perspectives\u201d (Russell 2018).\n\n\n\n\t\u00a0\n\n\n\n\t\u201cAdverse Health Effects of 5G Mobile Networking Technology Under Real\u00a0 Life Conditions\u201d\u00a0identifies the wide-spectrum of adverse health effects of non-ionizing non-visible radiation and concludes that 5\u2009G mobile networking technology will affect not only the skin and eyes, but will have adverse systemic effects as well. They state that 5G will increase the cell tower densities by an order of magnitude. Radiation could penetrate much deeper into a small animal in comparison to a human,\u00a0 because of the much smaller animal size. The researchers point out that most laboratory experiments were not designed to identify the more severe adverse effects reflective of real-life conditions. \n\n\n\n\t\u00a0\n\n\n\n\tFor example, they do not include the real-life pulsing and modulation of the carrier signal and do not reflect the real life exposures of various modulations. In addition, the vast majority of experiments do not account for synergistic adverse effects of other toxic stimuli with wireless radiation despite the reality that people are exposed to a myriad of toxic insults every day. Science has documented additive, synergistic, potentiative, and/or antagonistic effects created by the combination of exposures. Combined exposure to a toxic stimuli and wireless translates into much lower levels of tolerance for each toxic stimulus and the exposure limits for wireless radiation when examined in combination with other potentially toxic stimuli would be far lower for safety purposes than those derived from wireless radiation exposures in isolation.\n\n\n\n\t\u00a0\n\n\n\n\tThe authors contend that almost all of the wireless radiation laboratory experiments that have been performed to date are flawed/limited with respect to showing the full adverse impact of the wireless radiation that would be expected under real-life conditions because they did not include signal information and only used single stressors. The researchers conclude that in aggregate, for the high frequency (radiofrequency-RF) part of the spectrum, currently published reviews show that RF radiation below the FCC guidelines can result in: carcinogenicity (brain tumors/glioma, breast cancer, acoustic neuromas, leukemia, parotid gland tumors), genotoxicity (DNA damage, DNA repair inhibition, chromatin structure), mutagenicity, teratogenicity,\u00a0 neurodegenerative diseases (Alzheimer\u2019s Disease, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis), neurobehavioral problems, autism, reproductive problems, pregnancy outcomes, excessive reactive oxygen species/oxidative stress, inflammation, apoptosis, blood-brain barrier disruption, pineal gland/melatonin production, sleep disturbance, headache, irritability, fatigue, concentration difficulties, depression, dizziness, tinnitus, burning and flushed skin, digestive disturbance, tremor, cardiac irregularities, adverse impacts on the neural, circulatory, immune, endocrine, and skeletal systems\u201d and \u201cfrom this perspective, RF is a highly pervasive cause of disease\u201d (Kostoff et al., 2020)\n\n\n\n\t\u00a0\n\n\n\n\t\u201cTowards 5G communication systems: Are there health implications?\u201d is a research review detailing research findings that millimeter waves can alter gene expression, promote cellular proliferation and synthesis of proteins linked with oxidative stress, inflammatory and metabolic processes.\u201d The researchers conclude, \u201cavailable findings seem sufficient to demonstrate the existence of biomedical effects, to invoke the precautionary principle\u201d (Di Ciaula 2018).\n\n\n\n\t\u00a0\n\n\n\n\t\u201cSystematic Derivation of Safety Limits for Time-Varying 5G Radiofrequency Exposure Based on Analytical Models and Thermal\u00a0Dose\u201d documents how significant tissue heating can be generated by 5G technology\u2019s rapid short bursts of energy.\u00a0 \u201cThe results also show that the peak-to-average ratio of 1,000 tolerated by the International Council on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection guidelines may lead to permanent tissue damage after even short exposures, highlighting the importance of revisiting existing exposure guidelines.\u201d (Neufeld and Kuster 2018)\n\n\n\n\t\u00a0\n\n\n\n\t\u201cExposure of Insects to Radio-Frequency Electromagnetic Fields from 2 to 120\u2009GHz\u201d published in Scientific Reports is the first study to investigate how insects (including the Western honeybee) absorb the higher frequencies (2\u2009GHz to 120\u2009GHz) to be used in the 4G/5G rollout. The scientific simulations showed increases in absorbed power between 3% to 370% when the insects were exposed to the frequencies. Researchers concluded, \u201cThis could lead to changes in insect behaviour, physiology, and morphology over time\u2026.\u201d (Thielens 2018)\n\n\n\n\t\u00a0\n\n\n\n\t\u201cPlanetary Electromagnetic Pollution: It Is Time to Assess Its Impact\u201d published in The Lancet documents the significant increase in environmental levels of radio-frequency (RF) electromagnetic wireless radiation over the last two decades. The study cites an evaluation that found 68.2% of 2266 studies in humans, animals, and plants demonstrated significant biological or health effects associated with exposure to electromagnetic fields. 89%\u00a0 of experimental studies that investigated oxidative stress endpoints showed significant effects and \u201cradiofrequency electromagnetic radiation causes DNA damage apparently through oxidative stress. The paper also highlights research that has associated RF exposure with altered neurodevelopment and behavioural disorders, structural and functional changes in the brain and the sensitivity of pollinators. \u201cThese findings deserve urgent attention.This weight of scientific evidence refutes the prominent claim that the deployment of wireless technologies poses no health risks at the currently permitted non-thermal radiofrequency exposure levels.\u201d (Bandara and Carpenter 2018)\n\n\n\n\t\u00a0\n\n\n\n\tThe review \u201cThermal and non-thermal health effects of low intensity non-ionizing radiation: An international perspective\u201d published by researchers of the\u00a0 European Cancer Environment Research Institute in Brussels, Belgium and the Institute for Health and the Environment, University at Albany, NY, USA reviews current research findings and states that, \u201cthe mechanism(s) responsible include induction of reactive oxygen species, gene expression alteration and DNA damage through both epigenetic and genetic processes.\u201d The paper states that \u201cexposure to low frequency and radiofrequency electromagnetic fields at low intensities poses a significant health hazard that has not been adequately addressed by national and international organizations such as the World Health Organization.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\n\t\u00a0\n\n\n\n\tThe\u00a0 literature review\u00a0\u201cEffect of radiofrequency radiation on reproductive health\u201d\u00a0published by the Division of Reproductive Biology \u0026amp; Maternal Health, Child Health, Indian Council of Medical Research documents research that has found a link between radiofrequency radiation and oxidative stress and changes to the reproductive system including sperm count, motility, normal morphology and viability. The review concludes that the \u201cavailable data indicate that exposure to EMF can cause adverse health effects. It is also reported that biological effects may occur at very low levels of exposure.\u201d\n\n\n\n\tA 2010 landmark\u00a0review study\u00a0on 56 studies that reported biological effects found at very low intensities, including impacts on reproduction, permeability of the blood-brain barrier, behavior, cellular and metabolic changes, and increases in cancer risk (Lai and Levitt 2010).\n\n\n\n\t\u00a0\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\tCancer\n\t\n\n\n\n\tThe US National Toxicology Program (NTP) Study on Cell Phone Radiation\u00a0found \u201cclear evidence\u201d of cancer, heart damage and DNA damage in a $30-million study designed to test the basis for federal safety limits (NIEHS\u00a02018). The heart and brain cancers found in the NTP rats are the same cell type as tumors that researchers have found to be\u00a0increased\u00a0in humans who have used cell phones for over 10 years. Thus, researchers\u00a0say\u00a0this animal evidence confirms the human evidence associating the exposure to cancer(Hardell 2019.)\n\n\n\n\t\u00a0\n\n\n\n\tThe Ramazzini Institute (RI) Study on Base Station RF\u00a0\u00a0was another large scale rat study that also found increases in the same heart cancers that the NTP study found\u2014yet the Ramazzini rats were exposed to much lower levels of RF than the NTP rats. In fact, all the RI Ramazzini radiation exposures were below FCC limits, as the study was specifically designed to test the safety of RF limits for cell tower/base stations (Falconi 2018.) Thus the Ramazzini study corroborates the NTP\u00a0findings.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\t\u00a0\n\n\n\n\tTumor promotion by exposure to radiofrequency electromagnetic fields below exposure limits for humans\u201d\u00a0is a replication study that used very, very low RF exposures (lower than the Ramazzini and NTP study) and combined the RF with a known carcinogen. Researchers found elevated lymphoma and significantly higher numbers of tumors in the lungs and livers in the animals exposed to both RF and the carcinogen, leading researchers to state that previous research (Tillman 2010) was confirmed and that \u201cour results show that electromagnetic fields obviously enhance the growth of tumors\u201d (Lerchl 2015).\n\n\n\n\t\u00a0\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\tEnvironment\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\u201cA review of the ecological effects of RF-EMF\u201d reviewed 113 studies finding RF-EMF had a significant effect on birds, insects, other vertebrates, other organisms and plants in 70% of the studies (Cucurachi 2013). Development and reproduction in birds and insects were the most strongly affected.

The scientists simulated exposures to RE-EMF at various frequencies from frequencies in use now with 3G\u00a0 and 4G to higher frequencies\u00a0 that will be used in 5G. They\u00a0 combined this information with with in-situ measurements of environmental RF-EMF exposure near beehives in Belgium in order to estimate o estimate a realistic exposure of honey bees at different developmental stages. The analysis shows that a relatively small shift of 10% of environmental incident power density from frequencies below 3\u2009GHz to higher frequencies will lead to a relative increase in absorbed power of a factor higher than 3. \u201cAssuming that 10% of the incident power density would shift to frequencies higher than 3\u2009GHz would lead to an increase of this absorption between 390\u2013570%.

This is especially important considering these effects are likely magnified by synergistic toxic exposures and other common health risk behaviors. Effects can also be non-linear. Because this is the first generation to have cradle-to-grave lifespan exposure to this level of man-made microwave (RF EMR) radiofrequencies, it will be years or decades before the true health consequences are known. Precaution in the roll out of this new technology is strongly indicated.\u201d\n\t \n\t\n\t\t\u201cCurrent radiofrequency radiation wavelengths we are exposed to appear to act as a toxin to biological systems. A moratorium on the deployment of 5G is warranted, along with development of independent health and environmental advisory boards that include independent scientists who research biological effects and exposure levels of radiofrequency radiation. Sound regulatory policy regarding current and future telecommunications initiative will require more careful assessment of risks to human health, environmental health, public safety, privacy, security and social consequences. Public health regulations need to be updated to match appropriate independent science with the adoption of biologically based exposure standards prior to further deployment of 4G or 5G technology.\u201d\n\t \n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\tExperimentally we showed that the reflectance of the human skin in the sub-THz region depends on the intensity of perspiration, i.e. sweat duct\u2019s conductivity, and correlates with levels of human stress (physical, mental and emotional). Later on, we detected circular dichroism in the reflectance from the skin, a signature of the axial mode of a helical antenna. The full ramifications of what these findings represent in the human condition are still unclear. We also revealed correlation of electrocardiography (ECG) parameters to the sub-THz reflection coefficient of human skin. In a recent work, we developed a unique simulation tool of human skin, taking into account the skin multi-layer structure together with the helical segment of the sweat duct embedded in it. The presence of the sweat duct led to a high specific absorption rate (SAR) of the skin in extremely high frequency band.\n\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t\tIn this paper, we summarize the physical evidence for this phenomenon and consider its implication for the future exploitation of the electromagnetic spectrum by wireless communication. Starting from July 2016 the US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has adopted new rules for wireless broadband operations above 24\u202fGHz (5\u202fG). This trend of exploitation is predicted to expand to higher frequencies in the sub-THz region. One must consider the implications of human immersion in the electromagnetic noise, caused by devices working at the very same frequencies as those, to which the sweat duct (as a helical antenna) is most attuned.\n\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t\tWe are raising a warning flag against the unrestricted use of sub-THz technologies for communication, before the possible consequences for public health are explored.\n\t\t \n\t\n\n\n\t\t\tExcerpts from abstract: \u201cInsects are continually exposed to Radio-Frequency (RF) electromagnetic fields at different frequencies. This paper is the first to report the absorbed RF electromagnetic power in four different types of insects as a function of frequency from 2\u2009GHz to 120\u2009GHz. A set of insect models was obtained using novel Micro-CT (computer tomography) imaging. These models were used for the first time in finite-difference time-domain electromagnetic simulations. All insects showed a dependence of the absorbed power on the frequency. All insects showed a general increase in absorbed RF power at and above 6\u2009GHz, in comparison to the absorbed RF power below 6\u2009GHz. Our simulations showed that a shift of 10% of the incident power density to frequencies above 6\u2009GHz would lead to an increase in absorbed power between 3\u2013370%.\u201d\n\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t\t\u201cThis could lead to changes in insect behaviour, physiology, and morphology over time due to an increase in body temperatures, from dielectric heating. The studied insects that are smaller than 1 cm show a peak in absorption at frequencies (above 6GHz), which are currently not often used for telecommunication, but are planned to be used in the next generation of wireless telecommunication systems.\u201d\n\t\t \n\t\n\n\n\n\t\u2022 Increased risk of brain, vestibular nerve and salivary gland tumors are associated with mobile phone use.\n\t\u2022 Nine studies (2011\u20132017) report increased risk of brain cancer from mobile phone use.\n\t\u2022 Four case-control studies (3 in 2013, 1 in 2014) report increased risk of vestibular nerve tumors.\n\t\u2022 Concern for other cancers: breast (male \u0026amp; female), testis, leukemia, and thyroid.\n\t\u2022 Based on the evidence reviewed it is our opinion that IARC\u2019s current categorization of RFR as a possible human carcinogen (Group 2B) should be upgraded to Carcinogenic to Humans (Group 1).\n\n\n\n\n\t\tIn 2008, we demonstrated that the coiled portion of the sweat duct in upper skin layer could be regarded as a helical antenna in the sub-THz band. The full ramifications of what these findings represent in the human condition are still very unclear,\u00a0but it is obvious that the absorption of electromagnetic energy is governed by the topology for the skin and its organelles, especially the sweat duct.\n\t \n\n\n\n\t\t\u201cPreliminary observations showed that MMW increase skin temperature, alter gene expression, promote cellular proliferation and synthesis of proteins linked with oxidative stress, inflammatory and metabolic processes, could generate ocular damages, affect neuro-muscular dynamics.\u201d\n\t \n\t\n\t\t\u201cFurther studies are needed to better and independently explore the health effects of RF-EMF in general and of MMW in particular. However, available findings seem sufficient to demonstrate the existence of biomedical effects, to invoke the precautionary principle, to define exposed subjects as potentially vulnerable and to revise existing limits.\n\t \n\n\n\n\t\t\u201cPrior research on human exposure to radio frequency (RF) fields in a cellular communications system has been focused on uplink only due to the closer physical contact of a transmitter to a human body. However, this paper claims the necessity of thorough investigation on human exposure to downlink RF fields, as cellular systems deployed in mmW bands will entail (i) deployment of more transmitters due to smaller cell size and (ii) higher concentration of RF energy using a highly directional antenna.\n\t \n\t\n\t\tIn this paper, we present human RF exposure levels in downlink of a Fifth Generation Wireless Systems (5G). Our results show that 5G downlink RF fields generate significantly higher power density (PD) and specific absorption rate (SAR) than a current cellular system. This paper also shows that SAR should also be taken into account for determining human RF exposure in the mmW downlink.\u201d\n\t \n\n\n\n\t\t\u201cthis report represents the first metabolomic investigation focusing on the effects of MMW.\u201d\n\t \n\t\n\t\t\u201cit is reasonable to assume that the vast amount of dysregulations reported in these sequences do not stem from alterations of gene expression but rather from alterations in membrane permeability, consistently with previous reports on acellular phospholipidic systems. \u201c\n\t \n\t\n\t\t\u201cfurther studies will be necessary to assess MMW bioeffects on animal models and to investigate potential dysregulations induced by lower IPD values prior to the wide-scale deployment of technologies based on these specific frequencies.\u201d\n\t \n\t\n\t\t\u201cThis unexpected extent of modifications can hardly stem from the mild changes that could be reported throughout transcriptomics studies, leading us to hypothesize that MMW might alter the permeability of cell membranes, as reported elsewhere.\u201d\n\t \n\n\n\n\t\tMillimeter Waves (MMW) will be used in the next-generation of high-speed wireless technologies, especially in future Ultra-Broadband small cells in 5G cellular networks. Therefore, their biocompatibilities must be evaluated prior to their massive deployment. Using a microarray-based approach, we analyzed modifications to the whole genome of a human keratinocyte model that was exposed at 60.4 GHz-MMW at an incident power density (IPD) of 20 mW/cm2\u00a0for 3 hours in athermic conditions. No keratinocyte transcriptome modifications were observed. We tested the effects of MMWs on cell metabolism by co-treating MMW-exposed cells with a glycolysis inhibitor, 2-deoxyglucose (2dG, 20 mM for 3 hours), and whole genome expression was evaluated along with the ATP content. We found that the 2dG treatment decreased the cellular ATP content and induced a high modification in the transcriptome (632 coding genes). The affected genes were associated with transcriptional repression, cellular communication and endoplasmic reticulum homeostasis. The MMW/2dG co-treatment did not alter the keratinocyte ATP content, but it did slightly alter the transcriptome, which reflected the capacity of MMW to interfere with the bioenergetic stress response. The RT-PCR-based validation confirmed 6 MMW-sensitive genes (SOCS3,\u00a0SPRY2,\u00a0TRIB1,\u00a0FAM46A,\u00a0CSRNP1\u00a0and\u00a0PPP1R15A) during the 2dG treatment. These 6 genes encoded transcription factors or inhibitors of cytokine pathways, which raised questions regarding the potential impact of long-term or chronic MMW exposure on metabolically stressed cells.\n\t \n\n\n\n\t\tAbstract: Over the next years the demand of wireless communication will increase tremendously. More and more mobile end devices require a high data rate connection e.g. to a smart home (Internet of Things, IoT) or to the internet. The radiation power pattern of base stations and mobile end devices will completely change for the 5G Next Generation Mobile Network technology which will use frequency bands up to 100 GHz. Therefore the electromagnetic exposure especially to human body will increase in the future, because most of the wireless connections are realized in RF technology. In this contribution two different measurement setups are presented. The first shows the electromagnetic radiation regarding a base station powered by a mobile phone provider over a timespan of a number of days. The second figures out the electromagnetic radiation of a handheld mobile end device to a human head in an area with very poor reception values. The results of those measurements where compared with legal and health limits. All measured and calculated results regarding the base stations were within the legal exposure limits. The calculated legal exposure limits of mobile devices were exceeded twice in areas within very poor reception values. Regarding the expected higher bandwidth and corresponding higher electromagnetic exposure to human bodies in future there have to be periodic measurements to comply with radiation limits.\n\t \n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tExcerpts: \u201cRegarding the above mentioned circumstances\u00a0it will be necessary to measure the radiation exposure of base stations in the future on a regular basis in order to ensure the legal limits and to reduce possible health hazards. It also will be necessary to develop new measurement strategies and/or technologies regarding the large frequency spectrum 5G will use up to 100 GHz. \u2026When measuring directly on a mobile phone (simulating the use of an end device directly on the human head), it was found that the calculated SAR of 3.834\u00a0W/kg\u00a0exceeds the legal limit of 2 W/ kg. This shows clearly that the legal limit values can be exceeded significantly in areas with very poor reception values \u2026Increasing the distance between a mobile end device and the head, e.g. by using a hands-free set or a headset can significantly reduce the human exposure to electromagnetic radiation when such a device is used in badly supplied areas and transmits with maximum power.\u201d\n\t\t\n\t \n\n\n\tExtreme broadband wireless devices operating above 10 GHz may transmit data in bursts of a few milliseconds to seconds. Even though the time- and area-averaged power density values remain within the acceptable safety limits for continuous exposure,\u00a0these bursts may lead to short temperature spikes in the skin of exposed people.\n\n\n\n\n\t\tThis result indicates that careful consideration should be given while designing electronic and photonic devices operating in the sub-terahertz frequency region in order to avoid various effects on human health due to these waves.\n\t \n\n\n\n\t\t\u201cMorphological, functional and biochemical studies conducted in humans and animals revealed that millimeterwave caused changes in the body manifested in structural alterations in the skin and internal organs, qualitative and quantitative changes of the blood and bone marrow composition and changes of the conditioned reflex activity, tissue respiration, activity of enzymes participating in the process of tissue respiration and nucleic metabolism. The degree of unfavorable effect of millimeterwave depended on the duration of the radiation and individual characteristics of the organism.\u201d\n\t \n\n\n\n\t\t\u201cThis paper analyzes general trends in the area and briefly reviews the most significant publications, proceeding from cell-free systems, dosimetry, and spectroscopy issues through cultured cells and isolated organs to animals and humans.\n\t \n\t\n\t\tThe studies reviewed demonstrate effects of low-intensity MMW (10 mW/cm2 and less) on cell growth and proliferation, activity of enzymes, state of cell genetic apparatus, function of excitable membranes, peripheral receptors, and other biological systems. In animals and humans, local MMW exposure stimulated tissue repair and regeneration, alleviated stress reactions, and facilitated recovery in a wide range of diseases (MMW therapy). Many reported MMW effects could not be readily explained by temperature changes during irradiation.\u201d\n\t \n\t\n\t\tFull paper in draft form\u00a0 is online as\u00a0CURRENT STATE AND IMPLICATIONS OF RESEARCH ON BIOLOGICAL EFFECTS OF MILLIMETER WAVES: A REVIEW OF LITERATURE\u00a0CURRENT STATE AND IMPLICATIONS OF RESEARCH ON BIOLOGICAL EFFECTS OF MILLIMETER WAVES: A REVIEW OF LITERATURE\u00a0Andrei G. Pakhomov, Yahya Akyel, Olga N. Pakhomova, Bruce E. Stuck, and Michael R. Murphy McKesson BioServices (A.G.P., Y.A., O.N.P.), U. S. Army Medical Research Detachment of the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (B.E.S.), and Directed Energy Bioeffects Division, Human Effectiveness Directorate, Air Force Research Laboratory (M.R.M.), Brooks Air Force Base, San Antonio, TX\n\t \n\t\n\t\t\u201cIt is important to note that, even with the variety of bioeffects reported, no studies have provided evidence that a low-intensity MMW radiation represents a health hazard for human beings. Actually, none of the reviewed studies with low-intensity MMW even pursued the evaluation of health risks, though in view of numerous bioeffects and growing usage of MMW technologies this research objective appears very reasonable. Such MMW effects as alterations of cell growth rate and UV light sensitivity, biochemical and antibiotic resistivity changes in pathogenic bacteria, as well as many others are of potential significance for safety standards. MMW therapy in many cases employs field intensities comparable to or lower than allowed by current safety standards; still, even local and short-term exposures were reported to produce marked effects. It should also be realized that biological effects of a prolonged or chronic MMW exposure of the whole body or a large body area have never been investigated. Safety limits for these types of exposure are based solely on predictions of energy deposition and MMW heating, but in view of recent studies this approach is not necessarily adequate.\u201d\n\t \n\n\n\n\t\tThis paper gives examples of today\u2019s regulatory requirements, and provides an example for a 60 GHz transceiver. Also, the propagation characteristics of millimeter-waves in the presence of the human body are studied, and four models representing different body parts are considered to evaluate thermal effects of millimeter-wave radiation on the body. Simulation results show that about 34% to 42% of the incident power is reflected at the skin surface at 60 GHz. This paper shows that power density is not suitable to determine exposure compliance when millimeter wave devices are used very close to the body. A temperature-based technique for the evaluation of safety compliance is proposed in this paper.\n\t \n\n\n\t\u201cA\u00a0 literature survey representing the most recent available results related to the biological effects of mmWave exposure, from the well-understood and well-accepted effects of thermal heating to recent reports of nonthermal effects and the attempt to motivate further discussion and research for appropriate emission standards.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\u201cWe highlighted the findings of mmWave radiation studies on the eyes and skin since, in communication applications, these tissues would receive the most radiation, with other tissues receiving, by comparison, a negligible amount. Ocular injury can be induced by short-term high-intensity exposure (e.g., 2,000 mW/cm2, 1.5\u20135 s) far beyond the anticipated future communication device levels, but the eyes do not appear to suffer damage from longer low-intensity exposure (e.g., 10 mW/cm2, 8 h), which might be experienced from mmWave communication technologies in the far field.\n\t \n\t\n\t\tMore work may be required to determine the possible effects from exposure above 10 mW/cm2\u00a0that might be experienced in the near field from specific communication devices with adaptive antennas as well as to ensure that mechanisms are in place to ensure that no hazardous levels of energy are transmitted into the eyes. We also showed that using typical power levels, there would be no unsafe temperature increase caused by exposure of skin to mmWave communication technologies in the far field.\n\t \n\t\n\t\tAs with the eyes, however, more work is required to determine temperature increases from higher exposure levels that might be experienced in the near field from specific communication devices with high-gain antennas and to develop and demonstrate reliable mechanisms to ensure that no hazardous levels of energy are transmitted to the skin.\u201d\n\t \n\n\n\n\t\tThe millimeter waves (MMW) region of the electromagnetic spectrum, extending from 30 to 300 GHz in terms of frequency (corresponding to wavelengths from 10 mm to 1 mm), is officially used in non-invasive complementary medicine in many Eastern European countries against a variety of diseases such gastro duodenal ulcers, cardiovascular disorders, traumatism and tumor. On the other hand, besides technological applications in traffic and military systems, in the near future MMW will also find applications in high resolution and high-speed wireless communication technology. This has led to restoring interest in research on MMW induced biological effects. In this review emphasis has been given to the MMW-induced effects on cell membranes that are considered the major target for the interaction between MMW and biological systems.\n\t \n\n\n\tScientific Citations from the published study \u201cPotential Risks to Human Health Originating from Future Sub-MM Communication Systems\u201d\u00a0 by Paul Ben-Ishai, PhD and Yuri Feldman, PhD\n\n\n\n\n\t\tFeldman, Yuri and Paul Ben-Ishai.\u00a0\u201cPotential Risks to Human Health Originating from Future Sub-MM Communication Systems.\u201d\u00a0Abstract, 2017.\n\t \n\t\n\t\tFeldman, Yuri, et al.\u00a0\u201cHuman skin as arrays of helical antennas in the millimeter and submillimeter wave range.\u201d\u00a0Physical Review Letters, vol. 100, no. 12, 2008.\n\t \n\t\n\t\tHayut, Itai, et al.\u00a0\u201cCircular polarization induced by the three-dimensional chiral structure of human sweat ducts.\u201d\u00a0Physical Review, vol. 89, no. 4, 2014.\n\t \n\t\n\t\tHayut, Itai, et al.\u00a0\u201cThe Helical Structure of Sweat Ducts: Their Influence on the Electromagnetic Reflection Spectrum of the Skin.\u201d\u00a0IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology, vol. 3, no. 2, 2013, pp. \u00a0207-15.\n\t \n\t\n\t\tProfessor Yuri Feldman \u2013\u00a0Research Study Summaries, The Hebrew University of Jerusalem Department of Applied Physics, Dielectric Spectroscopy Laboratory\n\t \n\t\n\t\t\u00a0\n\t \n\n\n\tRESEARCH ON MILLIMETER WAVES\n\n\n\n\t\u00a0\n\n\n\n\tGene expression changes in the skin of rats induced by prolonged 35 GHz millimeter-wave exposure.

In large studies, an association has been observed between symptoms and exposure to these fields in the everyday environment.\u201d\n\n\n\n\tCompilation of Research Studies on Cell Tower Radiation and Health\n\n\n\n\n\t\tThis study evaluated effects in the human blood of individuals living near mobile phone base stations (within 80 meters) compared with healthy controls (over 300 meters). The study found higher radiofrequency radiation exposures and statistically significant differences in the blood of people living closer to the cellular antennas. The \u00a0group living closer to the antennas had for example, statistically significant higher frequency of micronuclei and a rise in lipid peroxidation in their blood. These changes are considered biomarkers predictive of cancer.\n\t \n\n\n\n\t\tThis study found that living nearby mobile phone base stations (cell antennas) increased the risk for neuropsychiatric problems such as headaches, memory problems, dizziness, tremors,depression, sleep problems and some changes in the performance of neurobehavioral functions. \u00a0\n\t \n\n\n\n\t\tThis review of 100 studies found approximately 80% showed biological effects near towers. \u201cBoth anecdotal reports and some epidemiology studies have found headaches, skin rashes, sleep disturbances, depression, decreased libido, increased rates of suicide, concentration problems, dizziness, memory changes, increased risk of cancer, tremors, and other neurophysiological effects in populations near base stations.\u201d \u00a0\n\t \n\n\n\n\t\tThis 10 year study on cell phone antennas by the Municipal Health Department in Belo Horizonte and several universities in Brazil found a clearly elevated relative risk of cancer mortality at residential distances of 500 meters or less from cell phone transmission towers. Shortly after this study was published, the city prosecutor sued several cell phone companies and requested that almost half of the cities antennas be removed. Many antennas were dismantled.\n\t \n\n\n\n\t\tA review of 10 epidemiological studies that assessed for negative health effects of mobile phone base stations (4 studies were from Germany, and 1 each from Austria, Egypt, France, Israel, Poland, Spain) found that seven showed altered neurobehavioral effects near cell tower and three showed increased cancer incidence. The review also found that eight of the 10 studies reported increased prevalence of adverse neurobehavioral symptoms or cancer in populations living at distances \u0026lt; 500 meters from base stations. Lower cognitive performance was found in \u00a0individuals living \u2264 10 meters from base stations. None of the studies reported exposure above accepted international guidelines, suggesting that current guidelines may be inadequate in protecting the health of human populations.\n\t \n\n\n\n\t\tThis \u00a0cross-sectional study found the symptoms of nausea, headache, dizziness, irritability, discomfort, nervousness, depression, sleep disturbance, memory loss and lowering of libido were statistically increased in people living closer than 300\u2009m from cell antennas as compared to those living farther away. The study concludes that \u201cantennas should not be sited closer than 300\u2009m to people to minimize exposure.\u201d\n\t \n\n\n\n\t\tEven a year of operation of a powerful base transmitting station for mobile communication reportedly resulted in a dramatic increase of cancer incidence among population living nearby. \u00a0\n\t \n\n\n\n\t\tElementary school students who were exposed to high RF-EMFR generated by MPBS had a significantly higher risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus relative to their counterparts who were exposed to lower RF-EMFR. \u00a0\n\t \n\n\n\n\t\tRFR exposures significantly impacted ACTH, cortisol, thyroid hormones, prolactin for \u00a0females, and testosterone levels for males.\n\t \n\n\n\n\t\tPeople living near mobile phone masts reported more symptoms of headache, sleep disturbance, discomfort, irritability, depression, memory loss and concentration problems the closer they lived to the installation. \u00a0Study authors recommend that the minimal distance of people from cellular phone base stations should not be \u0026lt; 300 m.\n\t \n\n\n\tNavarro EA, Segura J, Portoles M, Gomez-Perretta C,\u00a0The Microwave Syndrome: A preliminary Study. 2003 (Spain) Electromagnetic Biology and Medicine, Volume 22, Issue 2, (2003): 161 \u2013 169\n\n\n\n\n\t\tStatistically significant positive exposure-response associations between RFR intensity and fatigue, irritability, headaches, nausea, loss of appetite, sleeping disorder, depressive tendency, feeling of discomfort, difficulty in concentration, loss of memory, visual disorder, dizziness and cardiovascular problems. \u00a0\n\t \n\n\n\tTwo Important Animal Studies on Radiofrequency Radiation\n\n\n\n\tThese studies indicate that government limits are non protective. Government limits are based on the assumption that radiofrequency radiation is only harmful at thermal levels. However, the cancers developed in animals in these studies at radiation levels that were non thermal.\n\n\n\n\n\t\tResearchers with the renowned Ramazzini Institute (RI) in Italy performed a large-scale lifetime\u00a0study\u00a0of lab animals exposed to environmental levels (comparable to allowable limits from cell towers) of RFR radiation and found the rats developed increased cancers- schwannoma of the heart in male rats. This study confirms the $25 million\u00a0US National Toxicology Program\u00a0study which used much higher levels of cell phone radiofrequency (RF) radiation, but also reported finding the same unusual cancers as the Ramazzini- schwannoma of the heart in male rats. In addition, the RI study of cell tower radiation also found increases in malignant brain (glial) tumors in female rats and precancerous conditions including Schwann cells hyperplasia in both male and female rats.\n\t \n\t\n\t\t\u201cOur findings of cancerous tumors in rats exposed to environmental levels of RF are consistent with and reinforce the results of the US NTP studies on cell phone radiation, as both reported increases in the same types of tumors of the brain and heart in Sprague-Dawley rats. Together, these studies provide sufficient evidence to call for the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) to re-evaluate and re-classify their conclusions regarding the carcinogenic potential of RFR in humans,\u201d said Fiorella Belpoggi PhD, study author and RI Director of Research.\n\t \n\t\n\t\tThe Ramazzini study exposed 2448 Sprague-Dawley rats from prenatal life until their natural death to \u201cenvironmental\u201d cell tower radiation for 19 hours per day (1.8 GHz GSM radiofrequency radiation (RFR) of 5, 25 and 50 V/m). RI exposures mimicked base station emissions like those from cell tower antennas, and exposure levels were far less than those used in the NTP studies of cell phone radiation.\n\t \n\t\n\t\tWatch Press Conference\n\t \n\n\n\n\t\tThis 25 million dollar study is the most complex study completed by the NTP and the world\u2019s largest rodent study on radiofrequency radiation exposure to date which found long term exposure at non thermal levels associated with brain cancer and schwannomas of the heart in male rats. In addition damage to heart was found in all exposure levels. The full report is expected to be released in Fall 2018.\n\t \n\n\n\tMore Important Studies on Cell Tower Radiation \u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\t\tRadiofrequency radiation (RF) is increasingly being recognized as a new form of\u00a0environmental pollution. \u00a0This article \u00a0reviews relevant\u00a0electromagnetic\u00a0frequencies, exposure standards and current scientific literature on the health implications of 2G, 3G, 4G and 5G.\n\t \n\t\n\t\tEffects can also be non-linear. Because this is the first generation to have cradle-to-grave lifespan exposure to this level of man-made microwave (RF EMR) radiofrequencies, it will be years or decades before the true health consequences are known. Precaution in the roll out of this new technology is strongly indicated.\n\t \n\n\n\n\t\tResearchers have developed a unique simulation tool of human skin, taking into account the skin\u00a0multi-layer structure\u00a0together with the helical segment of the sweat duct embedded in it. They found that the presence of the sweat duct led to a high specific absorption rate (SAR) of the skin in\u00a0extremely high frequency\u00a0band that will be used in 5G. \u201cOne must consider the implications of human immersion in the electromagnetic noise, caused by devices working at the very same frequencies as those, to which the sweat duct (as a helical antenna) is most attuned. We are raising a warning flag against the unrestricted use of sub-THz technologies for communication, before the possible consequences for public health are explored.\u201d\n\t \n\n\n\n\t\tThis article was published in Environmental Science \u0026amp; Policy by human rights experts. It argues that cell tower placement is a human rights issue for children.\n\t \n\t\n\t\t\u201cWe argue that (1) because protection of children is a high threshold norm in Human Right \u00a0law and (2) the binding language of the Convention on the Rights of the Child obliges States Parties to provide a higher standard of protection for children than adults, any widespread or systematic form of environmental pollution that poses a long-term threat to a child\u2019s rights to life, development or health may constitute an international human rights violation.\n\t \n\t\n\t\tIn particular we have explained how the dearth of legislation to regulate the installation of base stations \u00a0(cell towers) in close proximity to children\u2019s facilities and schools clearly constitutes a human rights concern according to the language of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, a treaty that has been ratified by all European States.\n\t \n\n\n\n\t\tThis research looked at the radiation that cell towers emit and states a safety zone is needed around the towers to ensure safe sleeping areas. The authors state that \u201crespective authorities should ensure that people reside far from the tower by 120m or more depending on the power transmitted to avoid severe health effect.\u201d\n\t \n\n\n\n\t\tThis cross-sectional case control study on genetic damage in individuals living near cell towers found genetic damage parameters of DNA were significantly elevated. The authors state,\u201d The genetic damage evident in the participants of this study needs to be addressed against future disease-risk, which in addition to neurodegenerative disorders, may lead to cancer.\u201d\n\t \n\n\n\n\t\tThis review summarizes the evidence stating that excessive exposure to magnetic fields from power lines and other sources of electric current increases the risk of development of some cancers and neurodegenerative diseases, and that excessive exposure to RF radiation increases risk of cancer, male infertility, and neurobehavioral abnormalities.\n\t \n\n\n\n\t\tJapanese study Showed Statistically Significant Adverse Health Effects from electromagnetic radiation from mobile phone base stations. Residents of a condominium building that had cell tower antennas on the rooftop were examined before and after cell tower antennas were removed. In 1998, 800MHz cell antennas were installed, then later in 2008 a second set of antennas (2GHz) were installed. \u00a0Medical exams and interviews were conducted before and after the antennas were removed in 2009 on 107 residents of the building who had no prior knowledge about possible. These results lead researchers to question the construction of mobile phone base stations on top of buildings such as condominiums or houses.\n\t \n\n\n\n\t\tIn our study, 116 persons exposed to radiation from mobile towers and 106 control subjects were genotyped for polymorphisms in the GSTM1 and GSTT1 genes by multiplex polymerase chain reaction method. DNA damage in peripheral blood lymphocytes was determined using alkaline comet assay in terms of tail moment (TM) value and micronucleus assay in buccal cells (BMN). Our results indicated that TM value and BMN frequency were higher in an exposed population compared with a control group and the difference is significant. In our study, we found that different health symptoms, such as depression, memory status, insomnia, and hair loss, were significantly associated with exposure to EMR. Damaging effects of nonionizing radiation result from the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and subsequent radical formation and from direct damage to cellular macromolecules including DNA.\n\t \n\n\n\n\t\tFound a significant relationship between some cognitive symptoms and measured power density in 365 subjects; highest for headaches. Perceptual speed increased, while accuracy decreased insignificantly with increasing exposure levels.\n\t \n\n\n\n\t\tA health survey was carried out in La \u00d1ora, Murcia, Spain, in the vicinity of two GSM 900/1800 MHz cellular phone base stations. The adjusted (sex, age, distance) logistic regression model showed statistically significant positive exposure-response associations between the E-field and the following variables: fatigue, irritability, headaches, nausea, loss of appetite, sleeping disorder, depressive tendency, feeling of discomfort, difficulty in concentration, loss of memory, visual disorder, dizziness and cardiovascular problems.\n\t \n\n\n\n\t\tResidents close to mobile phone masts reported: more incidences of circulatory problems, sleep disturbances, irritability, depression, blurred vision and concentration difficulties the nearer they lived to the mast.\n\t \n\t\n\t\tThe performed studies showed the relationship between the incidence of individual symptoms, the level of exposure, and the distance between a residential area and a base station.\n\t \n\n\n\n\t\tA significant higher rate of cancer (300% increase) among all residents living within 300m radius of a mobile phone mast for between three and seven years was detected.\n\t \n\t\n\t\t900% cancer increase among women alone\n\t \n\t\n\t\tIn the area of exposure (area A) eight cases of different kinds of cancer were diagnosed in a period of only one year. This rate of cancers was compared both with the rate of 31 cases per 10,000 per year in the general population and the 2/1222 rate recorded in the nearby clinic (area B). The study indicates an association between increased incidence of cancer and living in proximity to a cell-phone transmitter station.\n\t \n\n\n\n\t\tGerman study showing elevated levels of stress hormones (adrenaline, noradrenaline), and lowered dopamine and PEA levels in urine in area residents during 1st 6 months of cell tower installation. Even after 1.5 years, the levels did not return to normal.\n\t \n\n\n\n\t\t200% increase in the incidence of malignant tumors was found after five years\u2019 exposure in people living within 400m radius of a mobile phone mast. The proportion of newly developing cancer cases is significantly higher among patients who live within 400 meters of a cell phone transmitter. Early age of cancer diagnosis.\n\t \n\n\n\n\t\t\u201cIt can be seen from the above that 10 different well-documented microwave EMF effects can be easily explained as being a consequence of EMF VGCC activation: oxidative stress, elevated single and double strand breaks in DNA, therapeutic responses to such EMFs, breakdown of the blood-brain barrier, cancer, melatonin loss, sleep dysfunction, male infertility and female infertility.\u201d\n\t \n\n\n\n\t\tNon-thermal microwave/lower frequency electromagnetic fields (EMFs) act via voltage-gated calcium channel (VGCC) activation.\n\t \n\t\n\t\tTwo U.S. government reports from the 1970s to 1980s provide evidence for many neuropsychiatric effects of non-thermal microwave EMFs, based on occupational exposure studies. 18 more recent epidemiological studies, provide substantial evidence that microwave EMFs from cell/mobile phone base stations, excessive cell/mobile phone usage and from wireless smart meters can each produce similar patterns of neuropsychiatric effects, with several of these studies showing clear dose\u2013response relationships.\n\t \n\t\n\t\tLesser evidence from 6 additional studies suggests that short wave, radio station, occupational and digital TV antenna exposures may produce similar neuropsychiatric effects. Among the more commonly reported changes are sleep disturbance/insomnia, headache, depression/depressive symptoms, fatigue/tiredness, dysesthesia, concentration/attention dysfunction, memory changes, dizziness, irritability, loss of appetite/body weight, restlessness/anxiety, nausea, skin burning/tingling/dermographism and EEG changes. In summary, then, the mechanism of action of microwave EMFs, the role of the VGCCs in the brain, the impact of non-thermal EMFs on the brain, extensive epidemiological studies performed over the past 50 years, and five criteria testing for causality, all collectively show that various non-thermal microwave EMF exposures produce diverse neuropsychiatric effects.\n\t \n\n\n\t\u00a0\n\n",
